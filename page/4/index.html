            <h1><a href="../../mountain-lions-and-fallen-logs/">Mountain lions and fallen logs</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>In which L and I see a mountain lion and stumble over far too many fallen trees.</p>

<p>So the "main" purpose of our trip to the States was for me to compete in the World Rogaine Champs in the Black Hills of South Dakota (in other words, a good excuse to visit my eldest brother and his wife who live in Salt Lake City!). Plus the furthest afield I'd ever been up until this point had been bashing around in the bush somewhere in Australia so it was probably about time I headed off overseas somewhere like everyone else seems to do.</p>

<p>This is not the first time I've competed in the World Rogaine Champs. My first time was in <a href="../../world_rogaine_champs_cheviot/">Cheviot in 2010</a> a few years back. But this time was a rather more serious approach as L is amazing and we had the potential, if we had a good race, to make it onto the podium. Yeah, just a little bit of pressure. Mostly though we just wanted to do the best that we could (and not get eaten by a mountain lion or bitten by a rattlesnake). I hadn't had the best build up to this race either with a foot injury earlier in the year meaning I had to do a lot of cycle training instead.</p>

<p>The day before the race was supposed to be relaxing but ended up being stressful with M having to take the place of one of the other guys in the Open Men's team at the last minute. We'd both not had the best sleep that week either which was starting to worry me. In the afternoon my brother and his wife arrived which helped keep my mind off the following day a bit though.</p>

<p>Race morning and I'm not sure if many of us managed to stomach breakfast all too well. I was so nervous (and worried about M...silly me!). We arrived at the event with lots of time and managed to find a space at a table in the big tent next to some Aussie teams (3 of the 4 were actually ex Kiwis!) and nervously awaited map handout. Once we got our maps though it was all go. It didn't take us too long to plan our route as there seemed to us to be a clear part of the map that we wanted to be once it got dark (the north east corner) so we planned our (highly optimistic) route around this.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bAgEp9AkTcw/VB_pGq3I_3I/AAAAAAAAF0U/HjW_36Efij4/s640/rogaine-before.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">L and I pre race. Yep, the map is huge but bear in mind we'd already cut it down a bit too. Good for hiding under in case of rain right?</p>

<p>About 11:45am we were all ushered into the start area for an anxious 15 minute wait until the gun went off. It looked like there were a large amount of teams heading to the same first control as us (#25) so we set off fairly fast in order to not get held up in a queue. Seemed pretty successful. What always amazes me is how quickly teams spread out and how, despite there being something like 500 other people out there, we were mostly by ourselves by the 3rd control.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nK-RD_7W3UQ/VB_pP-3cO-I/AAAAAAAAF0c/UZVPOzQmbig/s640/_DSF0161.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">And we're off...the line of runners heading off to control #25. It's somewhere up in the bush there.</p>

<p>It all started out so well for the first hour but then the heat started to get to me and I found I couldn't seem to keep down any food other than chomps. Fortunately I was still able to drink so I wasn't getting dehydrated but I was losing energy fast. We tried sitting down for a couple of minutes at a time in order to help get food down but it wasn't working. Heat and incredibly rough terrain was not helping  but I'm pretty stubborn when I want to be so there was no way I was giving up. We made it to the first water stop around 6:30pm, later than we'd wanted (although the terrain was turning out to be even rougher than the model map had been which seemed almost impossible!). There were people there to greet us and a note pasted on to the water barrel from L's partner and I think you could have actually seen our spirits lift at the sight of a friendly face. I managed to get down a gel and a few of L's corn chips and then we were off.</p>

<p>Darkness hit around 8:30pm (we had just made it to #74, determined to get there before requiring headlights) and we were faced with our first night control (#64), an incredibly vague spur in the middle of thick bush. Nailing that was an incredible boost for the spirits. We were heading back out through the bush after that control when L suddenly stopped and bent down to pick up a stick, telling me that I ought to do the same. It was then that I saw the eyes watching us from under a fallen tree. Not too far from where we were standing I could make out the shape of what could only be a mountain lion, pretty much my biggest fear for this whole trip. We started making as much noise as we could and had our whistles at the ready whilst slowly trying to make our way back out to the track. The eyes kept watching us the whole way. It was only once we'd gotten back out onto the track that, after checking we could no longer see it, we started running, turning round every now and then just to double check. We nearly scared ourselves to death at the sight of a deer and the way our headlights lit up the reflectors on the track posts.</p>

<p>After a rather long stretch of not getting any controls (not that I suspect we could have navigated all that successfully to them anyway as it took a long time for the panic to die down!) we were back into the bush for some more vague controls to test our night navigation! Finally, around midnight, we made it to #41 and the easier navigation. Oh, and our friends G&amp;T who were also not having the best of races. We headed round the next few controls together which boosted everyone's moral before leaving them to go our own way. By this stage I could stomach a little bit more food (mostly just tofu and a few crackers so not ideal but better than nothing) so I was feeling a bit more on the planet.</p>

<p>Some time not long after 6am though we both had managed to develop incredibly sore feet. I've had sore feet in these events before but nothing like this. A change of socks, more vaseline and some pain killers brought about a small amount of relief but still, at times we were reduced to a hobble! I think in the last couple of hours we could have been a lot more aggressive but we just couldn't handle the foot pain and had decided that as long as we finished after 11:30am then that would just have to be enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-O81aAXGHHOI/VB_pSC3yflI/AAAAAAAAF0o/KqK_oHuFci4/s640/_DSF0193.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">L and I at the finish.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how relieved I was to finish, take my shoes off and sit down...24 hour rogaines are such painful things. Why do we do them?! But even better was seeing my brother and M at the finish line cheering us on.</p>

<p>This event was by far the toughest terrain I've ever been in (just the continuous battle through endless fallen trees for hours on end) but despite the pain and exhaustion it was actually really fun. We both agreed it was an excellent course (if not the greatest of maps) and we can now add mountain lion to the list of animals seen (although I think I would have preferred not to have seen one!). I definitely learnt some lessons and I have a long way to go in terms of figuring out a fail-safe food plan...sigh.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-92CSuKogEkI/VB_pSVkM4xI/AAAAAAAAF0s/W-CON4mGWJk/s640/_DSF0209.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">Yep, I sure was happy to be finished. I almost look fresh in this photo but I sure didn't feel that way!</p>

<p>There should have been a prize giving within an hour of everyone finishing but somehow there was a rather large technical disaster with the results and so we had to wait about 2 weeks for the results to be announced. So much anticipation! Somehow, despite having a pretty rough race, L and I managed to take second place in the Women's Open grade. My medal arrived in the post a few days ago but it all feels rather surreal without having a prize giving.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to my awesome brother R for the photos!</em></p>

            <p></p><p>Yep, we're finally back in the land of the long white cloud. Well, actually we've been back for just over a week now but my head is still all over the place.</p>

<p>I have returned with more vegan cheese than I can possibly cope with (well, only 3 packets but to be honest I'm over it all ready...I definitely prefer the european vegan cheese sorry!) and chocolate-covered pretzels! The guys in bio-security at Christchurch Airport weren't too worried about that but they did have a laugh at just how many pairs of sports shoes I kept pulling out of my bag. I feel like we bought the entirety of <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI</a> and <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/">Backcountry</a> home with us!</p>

<p>Anyway, I have much excitement to tell - from encountering a mountain lion in the dark to exploring Southern Utah in search of Doctor Who - but right now I need to go to bed so you'll have to wait to hear those stories.</p>

            <h1><a href="../../theres-no-such-thing-as-too-much-cake/">There's no such thing as too much cake</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>It's that time of year, the time when I get to eat lots of cake and feel a little bit more wise (you know, every birthday you're another year older so surely also wiser as a result!).</p>

<p>Thursday we had a farewell (for me even though I'll only be gone a month!) and a birthday celebration (also for me but for the 2 other workmates with early August birthdays too) which meant I <em>had</em> to make a cake! It was pretty late on Wednesday night when I started making the cake so went for something simple, the <a href="http://books.google.co.nz/books?id=9lW15qtZhqEC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=vegan+brunch+east+coast+coffee+cake+recipe&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xsDfXWo8kG&amp;sig=6AJ7A4DjA0u9TJC2lWvj6eAPRBw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xlrdU4riKpOD8gXc_YLoDw&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=vegan%20brunch%20east%20coast%20coffee%20cake%20recipe&amp;f=false">East Coast Coffee Cake</a> from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-brunch/">Vegan Brunch</a>, except I made a lemon cornmeal version which I've done before. It went down well.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-wwXaFeZjStA/U91iRBHLE7I/AAAAAAAAFxA/9uEdEObSymg/s500/lemon-cake.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Work got me the usual delicious vegan sandwich they get me (made specially by the bakery for me) while the others had the usual savouries and club sandwiches. A salad sandwich might sound a bit boring but actually these guys (whoever they are) make a pretty good one.</p>

<p>I may have eaten a little bit more cake (with delicious <a href="../../floods-of-yoghurt/">coconut yogurt</a>) for dessert that night...!</p>

<p>Friday, after work and a nice little walk with M, we headed out to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/BeatStreetCafe/443032965369?fref=ts">Beat Street Cafe</a> on Barbados Street for more delicious food. I ordered their Big Warm Salad with tofu (so so good) for my dinner.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-GXrNAGbAkPg/U91iSa0iZtI/AAAAAAAAFxI/meNm-ZQ9RF8/s500/tofu-salad.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>They don't have a vegan dessert on the menu but they do make a damn fine beetroot chocolate cake which they served with berries and chocolate sauce. I gather this is not normal but I'm sure they'd do this for anyone who asked. They also had a delicious looking vegan brownie but I can never turn down cake!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-bwyubwygoTQ/U91iUdAORbI/AAAAAAAAFxQ/2S3KgEbOS5s/s500/beet-chocolate-cake.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Then Saturday dawned ridiculously summery hot (despite still being definitely winter here so it was awesome!) so we went biking along the tops and round the bays and eventually ended up in Lyttelton to check out the new vegetarian cafe there, The Shroom Room.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-GIKKdYpFgM4/U91jaZ-x8cI/AAAAAAAAFx0/DNwpj3qCrMQ/s500/the-shroom-room.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>I had a delicious lunch of toast and hash browns with lots of delicious fried veges and salady stuff (yep, I'm good with descriptions).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-vIsj3DbKgrY/U91iXbArFVI/AAAAAAAAFxg/uUF_TDl8AbE/s500/vege-breakfast.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>And of course more cake was consumed...their vegan chocolate raspberry cake was amazing and quite possibly wins the mini cake competition of the last few days of eating!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Vb3mhtonpnc/U91imYkwOZI/AAAAAAAAFxs/_CqQAMP8Roc/s500/raspberry-chocolate-cake.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>All that food did make the final relentless climb up to the Kiwi pretty difficult though! But worth it.</p>

<p>It seems vegan cake is doing quite well in Christchurch at the moment. The Lotus Heart makes a pretty fine cake. Then there's the Beat Street Cafe and The Shroom Room and I also heard from the waitress at Beat Street that there is a lady who makes several kinds of vegan cakes to sell at the <a href="http://www.christchurchfarmersmarket.co.nz/">Riccarton Bush Market</a> which we haven't ever been to...but you can bet we'll be going once we get back!</p>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>In amongst training, spending up large at <a href="http://www.macpac.co.nz/">Macpac</a> (we went in to get a duffel bag and came out with 2 as well as lots of clothing and other, well, stuff!) and trying to sort out last minute things for our trip we have actually managed to go out and be social...well, once. Sunday lunch we headed to the <a href="http://casselsbrewery.co.nz/">Cassels &amp; Sons Brewery</a> (or simply The Brewery) in Woolston for M's Dad's birthday.</p>

<p>They have a veggie burger which can be made vegan (it even delightfully says so on the menu which is super nice). Obviously this is what I had since I can't really turn down a burger and fries! I assume they still have a vegan beer they brew as we tried it a couple of years back at the <a href="../../delighting_in_a_food_coma/">Vegetarian Expo</a> (beer at 10am - not the best idea for someone who hardly ever drinks). It looked like some of the salads in the cabinet could have been vegan as well.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sMz_W2t_gBo/U9jCFvchfbI/AAAAAAAAFwo/f-ckWSkDE8U/s500/IMG_8858.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>It was big and delicious. I couldn't finish my chips but I was determined to finish the burger. I have definitely had more exciting burgers in other places but this was still pretty good (plus I was hungry by then).</p>

<p>Afterwards we came back to our place for (vegan!!) fruit cake M's Mum had made. I thought it was delicious! But then again I do love fruit cake. What's not to love about spicy, fruity cake? (sorry, I thought I had a picture of it but no such luck)</p>

            <h1><a href="../../winter-comfort/">Winter comfort</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>It's a bit chaotic round here at the moment. So much to do before we leave to head overseas and I'm getting so nervous. Race notes and rules seem to be coming out thick and fast and it's all a bit overwhelming. Plus I've never been further than Australia before. I should be excited but I'm currently just a bit terrified!</p>

<p>Anyway, while I attempt to assemble some kind of order I will leave you with some of the more exciting food we've been eating this winter (in amongst the standard stir frys and all that jazz).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sL1y0hA0bLg/U9NyfKar2aI/AAAAAAAAFvo/3TU9sMX2MEM/s500/IMG_8598.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>One of my favourite dishes is the Lime Peanut Noodles with Seitan, Kale and Carrots recipe from <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Vegan-Yum-Yum-Lauren-Ulm/9780757313806">Vegan Yum Yum</a>. Well, I've never actually make it with seitan. Normally we just make it with a particular tofu that I get at the Funky Pumpkin (thinly sliced and fried) and we just use what ever vegetables we have on hand. Mushrooms, onion, capsicum, courgette, broccoli, spinach...all good things! It's even good cold or at room temperature inbetween <a href="../../the-24hr-hens-party/">TWALK legs</a>!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ib_Y7NIJZfw/U9Ny4twZLuI/AAAAAAAAFv0/bejV75L9Cyo/s500/macncheez.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Also awesome is the vegan mac and cheez from <a href="http://yeahthatveganshit.blogspot.co.nz/2007/10/creamiest-vegan-mac-n-cheez-ever.html">Yeah That "Vegan Shit</a>. I normally fry an onion and, if I'm feeling virtuous, some veggies to go in it too. And, because I'm lazy, it's really easy to just make in one pot rather than the 2 mentioned in the recipe. Seems to taste just as good to me! It's a great winter comfort food and delicious with salad.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qMF1DqtlJ3g/U9NziNUq6MI/AAAAAAAAFwA/TYTLpDCi-OQ/s500/corn-1.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Also good with salad is the <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/good-morning/simon-holst-s-recipes-pumpkin-cakes-corn-chip-casserole-2-june-2762424">Corn Chip Casserole</a> from Alison and Simon Holst's <a href="http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Very-Easy-Vegetarian-Alison-Holst-Simon-Holst/9781877246739">Very Easy Vegetarian</a>. It's not too hard to veganise. Just make up a white/cheezy sauce with soy milk and yeast flakes (well, obviously a few other ingredients like cornflour to thicken it, some olivani or other vegan margarine type thing and a nice little shake of smoked paprika is always a good thing) and you're good to go.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-awKCBhXJaLk/U9Ny468qkMI/AAAAAAAAFv4/Rf2hN9p9GMU/s500/pumpkin-soup.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But for real winter comfort food you really can't go past Pumpkin soup. All you need is a pumpkin (obviously), onion, some delicious spices (like a mild curry powder, cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika...), some vegetable stock (I just use water and stock powder - the <a href="http://www.rapunzel.de/uk/index.html">Rapunzel</a> vegetable bouillon is my favourite) and something to blend it up with (here's where a stick blender is awesome). Easy! Well, apart from cutting up the pumpkin which I delegate M to do! Super delicious served with hot scones (I veganise the Edmonds scone recipe - it's awesome every time). The above scones are even cheese ones as I bought the <a href="http://www.buteisland.com/a_cheddar_chives.htm">Sheese Cheddar Cheese and Chives</a> at <a href="http://www.pikowholefoods.co.nz/">Piko</a> I didn't end up liking all that much. It made excellent cheese scones though!</p>

            <p></p><p>One of the things I love most about rogaines is the scenery. You get to go to places you would never normally be able to see (as the land is privately owned or you are well off the beaten track - busy thrashing through matagouri or climbing up through the tussock).</p>

<p>But there is always at least one moment where you wonder what on earth you are doing out there and you wish it could just end. Last weekend that moment came as we were clambering up the steep, rocky slopes of Mt Trotter. The tussock was so high I couldn’t see my team mate and was hiding the dreaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciphylla_colensoi">spaniard</a>, so I’d grab hold of some tussock to haul myself up with and find I’d managed to stab myself with the sharp points of the spaniard. It was worth it for the magnificent views and the 100 points we gained at the top though.</p>

<p>With no Heights of Winter last month I was definitely starting to feel anxious about not getting in a decent length race with my World Rogaine Champs teammate, L. We've done several short rogaines together (including a fun 3 hour one at Vic Park a couple of weekends back) and been in the same team for TWALK this year but a long rogaine is different. L is very fast and, as one of my friends says, an energizer bunny as well as being an excellent navigator. I was definitely getting anxious I wasn’t good enough to be her team mate.</p>

<p>Anyway, this past weekend we finally had a chance to race together at the Golden Road rogaine in Otago (in what was going to be a 13hr race but was cut down to 11 hours for various reasons).</p>

<p>A few of us drove down the night before and camped at the event centre (after a freezing weekend camping at Lindis Valley for a previous rogaine in April we all brought way too much gear for what turned out to be a fairly mild couple of nights!) so I picked up the map early and started planning our route...which turned out to be easier than normal - really just a matter of creating loops and working out which one to head out on first. So by the time L arrived I had a route all planned out (and fortunately she agreed with it!).</p>

<p>It was a pretty cold morning and we had a river crossing within a couple of minutes of starting (and then another one not long after that) so I think we were both glad to get to the first hill to start the warming up process. People were heading off all over the place and it only looked like a couple of other teams were heading out our way but they were a long way behind. This was pretty much the theme of the day as we hardly saw anyone out there and when we did they were going the opposite direction. It was like having the hills all to ourselves. Rogaines are funny like that. There could be hundreds of you out there but quite often you spend long periods of time seeing no one. Also, as usual, the scenery was spectacular. We didn't have a camera on us but there are some photos (and race reports) on <a href="http://tanecambridge.wordpress.com/2014/07/14/golden-road-rogaine/">Tane's blog</a> and <a href="http://runlongergeek.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/golden-road-rogaine/">Matt Bixley's blog</a> (complete with a photo of the awesome stone yards L and I got excited over).</p>

<p>We kept a pretty steady, quite fast (for me anyway, especially as I'd had a cold all week and was lacking that last bit of energy) pace, working as a team on our navigation. There was possibly a bit of a lack of focus (too much gossiping!) in the first hour but we got into a good flow. At just under 6 hours in we'd completed our first 2 loops so which meant we had time to head out the back to the far east of the map.</p>

<p>From #60 we ended up going to #42 first then #24 (the climb back up to this was tough going by this stage though) and in retrospect we should have left one of them out but we still thought we had time to finish with the #72 &gt; #48 &gt; #92 but by the time we actually got out to the road it was dark and we had 1 ¼ hours to go so it seemed too risky (if it had been daylight I think we'd have gone for it though) so we decided to abandon #72 and head straight to #48. We managed to screw up #48 and got ourselves into a panic (the first control in the dark is always entertaining!). Then it was an exhausting slog to the 90 pointer and down to #26 where we looked at our watches and saw we had about 15 minutes to go. We both joked that we'd get in trouble if we got back that early so we decided to risk another 10 points with #11. There was precious little time to get back to the finish after that so it was a mad dash down the hill to the woolshed where we got thwarted by all the stockyard gates! We must have clambered over at least 10 in our hurry! Made it with probably no seconds to spare!</p>

<p>All in all it was a great day and I am definitely feeling more confident about surviving the Worlds with L. We seemed to work well as a team and, most of the time, I didn't even feel too slow! Starting to get a little bit excited...2 ½ weeks until we leave!</p>
