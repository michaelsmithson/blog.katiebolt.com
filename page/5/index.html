        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>When we were house hunting the kitchen was a big factor for me. In our previous flat it was in a separate room and consisted of one small bench and nothing else. It had awesome amounts of cupboard space but used to drive me crazy. Oh, and the fridge was in the laundry because the room was so awkwardly designed there was no real room for it in the kitchen. I like to cook and when people would come over they always tended to hover around in the kitchen rather than hang out in the lounge which seemed rather awkward.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dvw1CQAon0Q/U75RDoxVqqI/AAAAAAAAFuI/QbXJ48cu_HM/s500/kitchen-1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, our new kitchen is still small but only 2 or 3 years old and way more functional (and it has a dishwasher!!) plus the lounge, dining room and kitchen all open out into each other so not only is it more functional but it's also full of light (well, in summer when there's more daylight of course). I love it!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rlD294Lth3s/U75TCplA_JI/AAAAAAAAFuU/4nGLZcaZCMA/s640/kitchen-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, we are awaiting our EQC repairs so the kitchen will be getting a bit of a makeover (new paint - a brighter colour and, hopefully, a blackboard! We might get new lino as well but we'll see). But who knows when that will be. I'm not looking forward to it. We've already been through the EQC process as tenants and that was bad enough! At least our house only has minor damage. And, with the help (or perhaps despair?) of M's Mum who does interior design, M has let me choose some lovely bright yellow paint for the laundry (but maybe I can sneak it into some other places too...!).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-h7ydfVRmf6g/U75THK6fh5I/AAAAAAAAFuc/21CsiLLFM6k/s400/IMG_8821.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So what's cooking on the stove there? Well, we had friends over on Saturday night for some trip planning and I made (steamed) Christmas Pudding but being all in the moment I didn't take a photo so instead you get a picture of the same pudding but from Christmas lunch (which we had at our place and hence I was in charge so it was all vegan which was pretty exciting). The flames were even more effective this time as it was dark and we turned off all the lights for the full effect. Some of our friends had never experienced the flaming pudding before so there was much excitement!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VCuR3mO_sRQ/U75OvHN3yoI/AAAAAAAAFtw/qXr8DtERbZE/s500/xmas-pudding.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The recipe is a veganised version of the pudding my Mum has made for the last who knows how many years. I think she found it from a crock pot book. If anyone is interested in the recipe let me know and I'll put it up. It's delicious!</p>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Chocolate! Now that's something we haven't had on the blog for a little while. Time to remedy that.</p>

<p>My work is near <a href="http://www.libertymarketnz.com/">Liberty Market</a> so most weeks I head over there to check out what they've got. Their stock seems to be fairly sporadic and you'll often find things you like only to have them never get them in again (sign). But they do always have a steady supply of interesting chocolates and this particular day my eye was caught...</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Cp-s54Jm9LA/U7aAWN2XZfI/AAAAAAAAFs0/X0rYUavPono/s400/pana-chocolate-01.jpg" alt="Pana Mint Chocolate"></p>

<p>Vegan mint chocolate? You've basically sold me already! It wasn't until I got it home that I realised it was raw chocolate (I must be going blind because it says it nice and bold on the front of the box) which did have me a little anxious at first because I've only tried one brand of raw chocolate I liked (and I have tried several). But from the moment I unwrapped it and the beautiful minty chocolate smell wafted out I was in chocolate heaven!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iaGOl4gVOa8/U7aAWQcIT2I/AAAAAAAAFs4/gPKxTFh-qus/s400/pana-chocolate-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The texture is super smooth and creamy and it had a pretty strong mint flavour which I love. No point in being mint flavoured if you can't really taste it. It's quite soft so you do know you're not eating regular chocolate but I guess it's kind of like a truffle texture.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_ebg3Y_g8Ak/U7aAWFY6CFI/AAAAAAAAFs8/Bu4SL7VvfOM/s400/pana-chocolate-03.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>And I must have really liked it since I bought another box of this <a href="http://www.panachocolate.com/">Pana Chocolate</a> on my latest trip to Liberty! In the interests of being a good blogger I probably should have bought a different flavour but I guess the other flavours don't tempt me enough to spend that kind of money. The way to my heart is clearly through mint chocolate!</p>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>I don't know what it's like where you are but here in Christchurch it is most certainly winter! In fact, last Saturday was the shortest day (so I guess we're heading back towards longer days again...but normally it's about the time the weather starts to really get into the wintery spirit). Fortunately, although there was minimal daylight, the sun was out (in a cold, wintery way).</p>

<p>Sunrise was 8:02am. We were a little disorganised so it was more like 8:05am when we were pulling out of our driveway. Fortunately The Goose was even more disorganised than us and was still eating breakfast when we turned up at his door so we went for a little spin while we waited. And then we were off...with a nice gravel hill to start with - up Rapaki to the Summit Road. I was very glad it was early in the morning and not too many people were about as there is one downside to tandem riding and that is that people do like to comment on it and that sure gets tiring after a while.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-XdvMOcj6qJ0/U601QgYo72I/AAAAAAAAFqc/yqL7p0D6htk/s640/ride-1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">Clockwise from top left: First cafe stop at Diamond Harbour; Cruising along the Summit Road; Charteris Bay; Heading along the coastline to Diamond Harbour.</p>

<p>We headed along the tops and down to Gebbies Pass with lots of whizzing and fun times then along the harbour edge to our first cafe stop of the day at Diamond Harbour where we lounged around drinking hot chocolates.</p>

<p>Next up was the second big climb, up to the Purau Saddle. I love this climb. The road is quiet and the climb is never too steep but is still relentless enough to be exhausting. We then whizzed down to Port Levy for a quick view of the sea before heading straight up again for the 3rd big climb of the day, up Western Valley Road, a nice (although I don't think M or the Goose would have called it nice!), truly relentless gravelly climb up to the Port Levy Saddle.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-aS7DikTLcKc/U607tEnwTiI/AAAAAAAAFrk/kqMFyjxfHPM/s500/ride-4.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">Slowly warming into the endless climb up Western Valley Road to Port Levy Saddle and loving every minute of it!</p>

<p>We all collapsed at the top, feeling rather hungry and tired. So it seemed an excellent time to pull out the mini chocolate cakes I'd made to celebrate The Goose's birthday. We practically wolfed them down!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1_OwJOiK_20/U603HiqVgTI/AAAAAAAAFq0/3Qxs6Mjukwo/s640/ride-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">Wolfing down cake at Port Levy Saddle.</p>

<p>The cake recipe, if anyone is interested, was a modified version of the Red Velvet Cake from <a href="http://www.compassionatecook.com/publications/the-vegan-table">The Vegan Table</a> by Colleen Patrick-Goudreau. Basically I substituted some of the flour for more cocoa powder, used coconut cream instead of soy milk, added some chopped chocolate and swirled some raspberry jam through each of the mini cakes (baked in a texas muffin tin - it made more than my tins could handle so I also mostly filled a regular muffin tin too). I also didn't add the food colouring. I totally recommend this cake. It's so moist and delicious!</p>

<p>After a rather exhausting, bumpy descent down into Little River (definitely a good test of how the tandem handles gravel descents) it was time for some serious refueling at the cafe there. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach in that moment though as I could only finish one of the samosas on my plate and virtually none of the salad. I must have been feeling tired! So the boys polished off my salad while I took the other samosa for the road. Don't worry though, my appetite came back with a vengence up the next hill!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-jnF4Y9B-MRI/U605WIyo4DI/AAAAAAAAFrM/_-tVsp2ZA44/s400/ride-3.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">Vegetarian Samosas in Little River.</p>

<p>And then for the last, and biggest, climb of the day, up  Reynolds Valley Rd to the top of Bossu Rd. I was definitely dying up this hill as it just kept going and going! It was definitely spectacular at the top though with stunning views of the Banks Peninsula in all directions.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-hNMD_CoO_EI/U60-sQLlKII/AAAAAAAAFr8/48imLR1veBE/s640/ride-6-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">Clockwise from top: Looking down Bossu Road towards Lake Ellesmere; Reynolds Valley Road; The Goose looking all suave near the top of the climb.</p>

<p>So all that remained was the descent down to Birdlings Flat, a nice little jaunt along the rail trail and then a cruise back into Christchurch. We'd be back not that long after sunset (4:59pm) right?</p>

<p>Not too far into the whizzing down Bossu Rd we got stopped by a vehicle informing us that the crossing over the ditch (draining Lake Forsyth out to the sea) to Birdlings Flat was, well, no longer a crossing so perhaps we might want to reconsider riding all the way down there. The boys, being boys, decided that surely there would be a way across and perhaps it wouldn't be too deep anyway (I was definitely not happy about this but when you're on the back of a tandem you don't exactly get that much say!) so down we went, chasing sheep left right and centre.</p>

<p>And yeah...there was no crossing and no matter how much wading The Goose did the water was not looking shallow enough to walk across. To make it more exciting, the sun was busy setting and only M and I had lights (The Goose was clearly under the mistaken impression that we'd actually make it back by sunset!). After well over an hour of dithering we decided to head back up the hill again...only just as we were about to head off into the darkness a local turned up with his little dingy offering to rescue the maiden in distress and her companions (he said he was only doing it because there was a girl in the group - yep, sometimes it definitely pays to be female!).</p>

<p>After 4 trips we were finally across (and the bikes of course!) and off to the <a href="http://www.littleriverrailtrail.co.nz">rail trail</a>...in complete darkness! There was much whizzing along (and desperate sandwich eating as we got more and more tired) and general good times and we made it to Motukarara in good time and good spirits.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-dtEI1YODgA8/U61Cvtjx8QI/AAAAAAAAFsU/gkkxwbzqCkQ/s500/IMG_8799.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>Once on the road again M decided it was time for some time trialling much to the despair of The Goose and I. We finally managed to rein him in at Tai Tapu and the rest of the ride was at a much more civilised pace but I sure was glad to get home...nearly 3 hours after sunset!</p>

<p>The ride has made me super excited for more explorations on the backroads of the Banks Peninsula. It's like an adventure playground for this kind of riding and it's right on our doorstep. Bring on summer and the longer days.</p>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Last weekend was supposed to be Heights of Winter, a 12 hour rogaine that happens every year in Canterbury around the full moon during June, but this year it was cancelled for, quite possibly, the first time after major flooding in North Canterbury earlier in the week. It's been a pretty wet year so far in Canterbury with with several floods in our street already and the hills are pretty green (they've been pretty brown for pretty much the whole time I've been here).</p>

<p>Anyway, we'd already booked a couple of baches in Gore Bay for the event so it seemed a shame not to head up there for the weekend anyway especially since the forecast was so spectacular.</p>

<p>Saturday a small group of us headed over to Kaikoura and up Mt Fyffe while the others did some other more epic icy mission. My favourite thing is going up steep hills so the track up to the hut was awesome (about 1100m). After that, however, the track started to get pretty icy and I ended up slipping over and hitting my head so M and I headed back down (and then up to the hutt again because hills are fun!) whilst the others continued. Spectacular views from the top and it wasn't even too cold!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tbRG92zPeH4/U6QCgYDKyUI/AAAAAAAAFp8/-Y8Q9lSbBWE/s640/mt-fyffe.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In the evening there was the most amazing full moon which I wished I'd taken a photo of. My friend C and I had a very lovely walk by moonlight along the beach. It was so beautiful and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore is like soothing music.</p>

<p>Sunday, after a lot sleep in (!), a group of us biked over the hills to the Hurunui River and back (with a few detours down to the coast). It was a perfect cycling day - not too cold and very calm.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Xbdbg6Rg2xA/U6QChSHtllI/AAAAAAAAFqE/3CyXm1fiCIs/s500/hurunui.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So all in all it was a pretty good weekend but still pretty sad there was no Heights of Winter this year especially since I could do with the training. We are heading to the States in about a month and a half for the World Rogaine Champs in South Dakota and I have yet to race a long rogaine with my team mate (other than TWALK and I'm not sure that really counts)! Hopefully the Golden Road Rogaine takes place next month. M has been helping me work on my route planning which is definitely helping.</p>

<p>But I better get ready for bed. Tomorrow is the shortest day here and we are planning on riding from sunrise to sunset (or something like that). Should be fun!</p>

            <p></p><p>Sometimes, if I'm lucky (and I'm lucky quite often!), M cooks dinner. Last week I was out running and he ate leftovers but then specially made me my own dinner (along with leftovers for lunch). I was so hungry there is no photo. But just imagine a delicious tofu stirfry on rice. Can't go wrong with that.</p>

<p>Another night he made an Indian curry with <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/product/chicken-style-strips/">Frys vegetarian chicken strips</a>. Delicious! Well, apart from being a bit too hot for me to handle!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fDTTxTHKi3k/U5qHmrUtwAI/AAAAAAAAFo4/QvFRZshB61k/s400/chickenindian.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Then a couple of weeks back M also made pizza!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-L1NSOIOsisQ/U6AW1sV1KsI/AAAAAAAAFpo/L8jazZWGBxo/s400/IMG_8677.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The dough was homemade (I love having a breadmaker!) and was topped with tomato paste, red onion, courgette, red capsicum, capers, tomato, tofu sausages and hummus. Hummus on pizza makes an excellent cheese substitute (it works best with plain hummus and don't be afraid to use heaps of it).</p>

<p>And last night he made me another tofu stirfry before we sat on the couch geeking out over rogaine maps.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eIsRgZk0mik/U6AWLQCY0rI/AAAAAAAAFpQ/kHRGnkofQy8/s400/tofu.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">I love how it looks like a piece of carrot is trying to escape off the plate!</p>

<p>These are actually just a few of the meals M has cooked lately so basically I'm rather lucky!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../birthdays-for-queens/">Birthdays for queens</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>This past weekend was Queens Birthday weekend (her birthday is actually in April I think but I'm not complaining) so we got a lovely long weekend for some fun adventures. The weather was looking fantastic (but cold) pretty much everywhere which make trying to work out what to do much harder! In the end M and I settled for doing some long tandem rides from Murchison each day since we don't have the panniers set up for the new bike yet.</p>

<p>Saturday, after driving up from home, we set off up the road for a nice warmup ride towards Maruia Saddle. We rode as far as the main bridge before turning back since the sun was on it's way down and it was getting cold. It was the first time we'd taken the tandem out on the gravel and it seemed to handle it with ease.</p>

<p>Sunday morning we were crawling out of bed early ready for a long day. The plan was to ride to Westport (for hot chocolates and hot chips of course) and back which would be the longest day ride for both of us, coming in at over 200km. Exciting! </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-e8EOJWz8Um0/U5Ar4jAfmtI/AAAAAAAAFog/6CGvTWQrHDI/s640/queen-01.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">Heading off to Westport following the mighty Buller River</p>

<p>It was a cold start but I'd warmed up by the time we got to the Upper Buller Gorge. The scenery was fantastic and there was very little traffic around so it made for pretty awesome riding conditions but M had promised me hot drinks in Inangahua which was about halfway to Westport. Unfortunately the only shop was closed (for sale I think) so we pressed on into the Lower Buller Gorge for more awesome scenery (and, finally, some sunshine!).</p>

<p>After a fairly painless 103km we'd made it to Westport and, after a quick trip out to the coast on the end of the pier (with a fantastic view back to the mountains and Denniston where we have ridden during a previous visit) it was off to the nearest cafe for hot chocolate and fries. Perfect! Not that we could stop long since we were conscious of the ever decreasing hours of daylight left!</p>

<p>The ride back was pretty good. We had a nice stop at the cafe in Berlins (it has a place name which makes it sound like a town but the only thing there is a cafe/accommodation) then it was back on the road. The sun vanished with about 20km to go and so too did any resemblance of warmth which made the end fairly torturous. I may have been wimpering a bit on the back!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3ONL-6G26Vw/U5Ar41UZL-I/AAAAAAAAFok/IXNeKo8C4Dk/s640/queen-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">So much awesomeness. Clockwise from left: Westport! The Lower Buller Gorge. Beautifully calm at Lake Rotoroa</p>

<p>But if I'd thought it was cold then, well, Monday had another thing coming. We headed off along the back roads (via Braeburn Track) towards Lake Rotoroa and, despite being wrapped up in several warm layers and super thick lobster gloves, I felt like I was getting colder and colder. Once my feet started getting cold my right foot was really playing up making it difficult to pedal. The Braeburn Track goes up a valley through the bush that clearly gets no sun during the winter months as the frost was thick on the ground and the gravel was icy.</p>

<p>I did eventually manage to sort of warm up in time for a bouncy decsent down to Lake Rotorua where we had a delicious lunch of only slightly squashed sandwiches! The lake was beautiful and I would have liked to stay there longer but it was too cold so we had to bike on.</p>

<p>Despite the cold it was a fantastic weekend and a good test of our tandem on gravel roads (and long distances). M has ideas of us doing the 400km Marlborough Mayhem Kiwi Randonneurs ride in October which is a little scary and if Le Petit Brevet is happening again this year we were going to give that a go so we're going to have to put in some more long rides over the winter. I better get used to being cold!</p>
