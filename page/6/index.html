        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Up in Auckland there is a cafe called <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews/raw-power-cafe-auckland-401">Raw Power</a> that I used to go to when I was in town. I loved all their food but my personal favourite (when I could drag myself away from the chocolate cake) was their vegan melting moments filled with delicious passionfruit icing.</p>

<p>Because I no longer have access to their delicious cookies I have to make them myself and I've found the good old Edmonds Cookbook will start you off in the right direction. Whip up a batch of their <a href="http://www.edmondscooking.co.nz/recipe-1/melting-moments">melting moments</a> cookies (using olivani instead of butter - make sure you mix the mixture quite a bit until it really starts to stick together otherwise you'll find yourself cursing as you try and make balls out of the mixture and it sticks to your hands and basically makes you all round grumpy).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FJjXWzGq4oc/U4g2d5INpCI/AAAAAAAAFoA/iYW_imZwTyo/s400/mm-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Once the cookies are cooled it's time to make delicious passionfruit icing! Soften about 60-70g of olivani (or other vegan butter substitute) and then whip that up with about 1 1/2 cups of sifted icing sugar until all mixed together and fluffy. Add some passionfruit syrup (or if you're super lucky, some passionfruit pulp but I've never been that lucky) to taste (quite a lot if you're using syrup) and voila!</p>

<p>Put dollops of the mixture sandwiched between 2 of the cookies and you've got yourself a serious treat.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>I've never been a salad fan and although I would eat it I general wouldn't have gone out of my way to make one. So I don't know what changed but this summer I've been in to salads in a big way. Most days at work I have salad for lunch which I make up in the morning and sometimes I'll make one on the side for dinner as well.</p>

<p>Here's Friday night's lazy dinner of salad and 'cheese on toast' (well on the delicious ciabatta buns they sell at our local New World). This is the blue Redwood Cheezly one. I've taken to ordering several different cheeses online from <a href="http://www.thecrueltyfreeshop.co.nz/">The Cruelty Free Shop</a> up in Auckland every now and then. My favourite is still the Sheese smoked cheddar but the Vegusto ones are pretty good. I'm looking forward to trying <a href="http://www.angelfood.co.nz">Angel Food</a>'s new cheese next time.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-o-EwMXTU0oI/U4GVCl3ZhCI/AAAAAAAAFnk/6s5veZmAAMo/s640/salad%252Bcheese.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, I got sidetracked! Right, where was I? Oh, salad. Right. Friday's salad consisted of spinach (not baby spinach but good old spinach - probably my favourite salad green - I chop it up so you don't get big leaves which I don't really like), grated carrot, capsicum, tomatoes, pepperdews (sweet piquant√© peppers), sundried tomatoes, dates, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds. Delicious! The dressing was our favourite Chermoula Dressing from the first <a href="http://www.revive.co.nz/info/revive-home/the-revive-cafe-cookbook">Revive cookbook</a>. I really like this dressing but you don't want to spill it on your clothes because it stains pretty bad (all the tumeric and cumin in it).</p>

<p>Today, after a morning ride on the tandem, we were in need of something to, umm, snack on whilst we caught up on the Giro action (M has turned me into a cycling addict). For some unknown reason I decided that I would try making the Peanut Butter Blondies that I'd seen on <a href="http://www.neverhomemaker.com/2014/05/healthy-peanut-butter-blondies.html">Neverhomemaker</a>. I say 'for some unknown reason' because normally I would turn my nose up at baking something sweet that contained a can of beans or chickpeas.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nZ1VPMv4W9M/U4GVYplk_aI/AAAAAAAAFns/midKd5H7Uj8/s400/blondie.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, it was made and we ate it and it wasn't too bad! Probably quite good really! I think I would make it again for lunches and stuff but not for something special. Yummy but tasted a bit too <em>healthy!!</em></p>

            <h1><a href="../../the-24hr-hens-party/">The 24hr hen's party</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>I'm still recovering from a long weekend of <a href="http://twalk.cutc.org.nz/">TWALK</a> adventures. TWALK is basically 24 hours of slightly mad fun running around in the hills trying to unravel cryptic clues (and then searching for the actual control) and getting your legs cut up by matagouri.</p>

<p>This was my 4th event (I missed out last year as I was in a cast and definitely not up to doing much) but M worked out it was his 15th TWALK! You can see more about my previous TWALKs <a href="../../since_i_ve_been_gone_/">here</a>, <a href="../../i_like_cookies/">here</a>, <a href="../../it_is_possible_to_eat_your_weight_in_food_/">here</a> and <a href="../../twalk_2010/">here</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-gDjUekCFN9w/U3seSZVqDQI/AAAAAAAAFm4/j7_LSWzZEg4/s640/twalk-start.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">And the madness of TWALK begins...</p>

<p>This year the event started at <a href="http://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap/nz27978/Lake-Clearwater/Canterbury">Lake Clearwater</a> and the scenery was, as always, stunning. The guys all went in one team (dressed as duck hunters (The Rubber Ducky Hunters) complete with their own maimai which M rode home with on his bike somehow on Friday night) and us girls all went in another (as the Hen's Party - we left feathers everywhere as the first leg went on!).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I6f3boOqzyA/U3shzTreY9I/AAAAAAAAFnU/dIEn6Gv9gZw/s640/twalk-1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">First leg fun amongst the matagouri.</p>

<p>This year's event was a little bit odd in that the first 3 legs seemed faster and easier than average so, very unusually, we made it through all 5 legs within the time limit although we didn't have much time for control searching by the 5th leg so it wasn't super successful. But, as usual, it was awesome (but more than a tiny bit brutal especially for those of us who were went out on all the stages). Basically it's the best event of the year!</p>

<p>I did intend to take some photos of the delicious lemon muffins I'd made to eat between legs but yeah, that didn't happen. But they certainly were good. I mean, I ate 5 of them during the race!</p>

<p>So next time I promise a food post.</p>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>This week marks my 3 year anniversary of moving to Christchurch and despite how crazy it has been it was definitely the best decision I could have made.</p>

<p>It's definitely been a 'different' experience though. I never thought I would be sent home from work or have the day off for earthquakes, snow and flooding (fortunately not all at the same time!) but there you go! This year has been the year of far too much rain resulting in pretty bad flooding across many parts of the city and, since we live by the river, it has been an interesting experience to say the least.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9ByC8YwzJ0g/U3BnFb8velI/AAAAAAAAFmU/4-ShPKenlJ4/s640/flooding.jpg" alt="">
</p><p style="text-align:center"><em>Somewhere under all that water is a road on either side of the river!</em></p>

<p>During the biggest flood, in March, we couldn't get out our driveway (well, we could if we'd really had to but it sure didn't look like fun). Fortunately we are high enough that the flooding doesn't affect our house but it's still pretty scary.</p>

<p>In more tasty news, I have just discovered a new vegan coconut yoghurt at my local supermarket. Doctors Choice Bio Yoghurt, a local Christchurch company, makes a <a href="http://www.bioyog.co.nz/dairy-free-coconut-yoghurt/">dairy-free coconut yoghurt</a> and it's really delicious!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uuhSTIc0wRo/U3BlVGrJswI/AAAAAAAAFl8/K8yGr2mW1VM/s400/yoghurt.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Seriously, if you see it I recommend trying it. Although I suspect it might only be stocked in the South Island at the moment.</p>

<p>Because it's late and I'm tired this will be pretty short but I guess what I should say is welcome to my new blog home!</p>

<li>I finished study and started a new job</li>
<li>M and I bought a house!</li>
<li>I crashed my mountain bike and kinda smashed up my right wrist</li>
<li>Ummm, we've been on far too many adventures to even begin mentioning!</li>

<p>But the most exciting thing going on right now? M and I bought a tandem! After several months of borrowing a friend's (and trying not to destroy it or us) we finally ordered our own. Stay tuned for more tandeming adventures!</p>
