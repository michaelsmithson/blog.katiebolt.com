            <p></p><p>I had been tossing up between the NZ Rogaine Champs and the <a href="http://www.arcevents.co.nz/arc2412/content/">ARC adventure race</a> (both were on the same weekend) but Michael pretty much refused to do a 24 hour rogaine so the ARC it was. We had really wanted to do the 12-hr but getting a double racing kayak is pretty hard and I was pretty disorganised in getting on to it so we settled on the 8-hr with the intention of racing it as hard as we could. But as the day was approaching I was feeling less and less keen...not helped by the fact I'd been sick for 2 weeks and had a lot of other things on my mind. It felt like deja vu from last year.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TYg_Xr6thrI/AAAAAAAAE8I/rxi7Rtybg2w/s400/IMG_1359.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Michael working on the raft</em></center> <br>
We had race briefing the night before and I have to admit, I started to feel quite excited, although pretty apprehensive, especially about the final mountain bike stage which had the potential to be the make or break section of the race and we all know how anxious I feel about mountain biking (well, you might not but basically it scares me half to death no matter how much of it I do). Then the morning of the race we had to get there early to build our raft...we were able to use 2 inner tubes, 2 lengths of wood and some rope and were supplied with wooden paddles.

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TYg_Ya10wUI/AAAAAAAAE8M/tr4ygagfNHo/s400/IMG_1361.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>The 12-hr and 24-hr teams set off on their first kayak leg</em></center> <br>
We finished our raft in time to see the 12-hr and 24-hr teams set off for their first kayaking leg and I really started to get excited, anxious and a bit jealous that we weren't out there kayaking (although also secretly relieved as the thought of a surf landing sounded pretty scary).

<p>Our first stage was the rafting. We were starting in the second wave of 8-hr teams at 8:20am and had to paddle our rafts across the estuary to the other side and pick up a couple of checkpoints then paddle back.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/3Xbo_1PjT1Q6Qv8RdDCU5iuD9EIDtq1DPm7c4WiqG2s?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TYgVzz92VNI/AAAAAAAAE7s/VeM16y53Gdk/s400/Stage1.jpg" alt="" title=""></a> <br>
<em>Stage 1: Rafting</em></center> <br>
Let's just say that our raft was, um, not so good. I think we needed the tubes further apart as it would tip over when Michael would try and get on so he basically swum the whole way while I swam most of the way. There was a bit of a current on the way over but on the way back it had got pretty strong and I got tangled up in some boats! The checkpoints were also a bit mysterious as the checkpoints ended up being round the wrong way which caused a bit of confusion. I was pretty relieved to get out of the water 'cause I was knackered! Swimming in shoes is tough work.

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TYg_aI3nptI/AAAAAAAAE8Q/L0_gRPnSs9A/s400/IMG_1368.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>The first 8-hr teams set off on the rafting section</em></center> <br>
After a fairly quick transition and a change of clothes and shoes we set off on the second stage which involved a mountain bike ride to the rifle shoot then on to the transition area at <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/coromandel/coromandel/wentworth-valley-track/">Wentworth Valley</a>.

<p></p><center><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/FNVCZLrr1Lg5uXclnY5VPCuD9EIDtq1DPm7c4WiqG2s?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TYgV2v8BD1I/AAAAAAAAE7w/QV-Hfhh4IAU/s400/Stage2%3A4.jpg" alt="" title=""></a> <br>
<em>Stage 2: Mtb and rifle shoot</em></center> <br>
It was a pretty easy ride along the main highway then on to some gravel roads. At the rifle shoot we each had 5 shots at the "ducks". Last year I'd got 5 out of 5 but clearly I was feeling a bit cocky this year because I stuffed up the first two shots which really frustrated me. Fortunately I managed to pull it together for the final 3 shots. Then it was a fairly short ride to the transition area where we dropped the bikes, grabbed quick bite to eat and a swig of water and then changed shoes for the trek stage.

<p>Stage 3 was a trek through the Wentworth Valley and up through the bush as well as an abseil down the Wentworth Falls (you can see a picture of the falls <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/coromandel/coromandel/wentworth-valley-track/">here</a>). We caught up to a few teams on our way up the gravel road to the first checkpoint and raced onto the mining track we figured CP0 would be on. Found a mine (it said Danger Do Not Enter) but couldn't find the checkpoint. A few other teams turned up and also went in and had a look but we were racing off to see if there was another one by then. Success. So then we were off as fast as we could to keep ahead. CP1 was pretty simple. But then we made our mistake...although we didn't realise it until much later.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/VKThsMBiTP9wLcYEK-9QByuD9EIDtq1DPm7c4WiqG2s?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TYhHdPsB17I/AAAAAAAAE9g/ruIEelCaDVc/s400/Stage3_2.jpg" alt="" title=""></a> <br>
<em>Stage 3: Trek and Abseil</em></center> <br>
From CP1 we bashed up a very indistinct trail through the thick native bush to CP2 and then bashed even further up (scaling some cliff at one point and passing some teams who started in the first 8-hr group - one of the guys we passed called me a 'bloody machine'!) to CP3 where there was the most incredible view down to the coast at Whangamata and beyond. I wish we'd had time to take a picture really. Then it was down through the bush (trying not to slide over although I did have a couple of falls) to try and find CP4. This was when Michael started to question what was going on. For some reason he'd thought the abseil was at CP4 but we were no where near water. We both started to freak out until I had a look at the checkpoint descriptions and realised we were supposed to have gone to the abseil from CP1 then start up through the bush. Bugger.

<p>Instead, we raced on to CP5 then down to the transition and raced back up the way we'd already come at the beginning of the trek to get to the abseil. It felt like a hell of a distance going back and we were going pretty fast to try and make up time so by the time I got to the waterfall I was knackered. I was in such a hurry I wasn't really thinking about how cool it was that we were abseiling down a 25 metre waterfall. Would so have loved to have done it again!</p>

<p>We made it back to the transition again in record time and got back on our bikes for Stage 4 which was a ride back to base. Pretty easy and so nice to be cruising on the bikes again after a pretty intense trek stage. I was definitely starting to feel weary by then too as I don't normally race longer events like this so hard!</p>

<p>We got back to base pretty quick and I attempted to get some more food down before we were off again for the final stage, a 2-hour mountain bike rogaine on the local tracks. It was pretty confusing as we were given 2 maps - a topo map and a trails map that you had to try and merge together to try and work out what was going on!</p>

<p></p><center><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Nm_16kFbOXPCMEJMDzB1-CuD9EIDtq1DPm7c4WiqG2s?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TYgVxnsTBKI/AAAAAAAAE7o/ZlSq8r3YE8s/s400/Stage5.jpg" alt="" title=""></a> <br>
<em>Stage 5: Mtb Rogaine</em></center> <br>
Fortunately Michael was doing the navigating while I was just attempting to keep up! But that got a bit tough so we loaded most of my gear into his pack which helped quite a lot on the hills. The route he'd planned out took us up to the highest point of the map before we slowly weaved our way down (with the odd steep uphill thrown in for good measure). The single track was pretty awesome riding (fortunately the rain the night before hadn't been too bad so the trails weren't too wet which was good 'cause they appeared to be clay based) but you had to be on your toes in case you missed the track you wanted or rode right past a checkpoint! We didn't see that many teams out there which I thought was a little weird but probably good as it's a bit frightening to be riding down a trail and meeting a team coming up.

<p></p><center><a href="https://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/P0-ro2FNMO_OJJhsWJiZOSuD9EIDtq1DPm7c4WiqG2s?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TYgVvIf3m9I/AAAAAAAAE7k/BUzJflQ-A0w/s400/Stage5-map2.jpg" alt="" title=""></a> <br>
<em>The bike park map for stage 5</em></center> <br>
We had trouble with a few of the controls mostly due to the mysteriousness of the maps (and the descriptions given for where some of the checkpoints were)!! But we actually managed to find all the checkpoints before we had to race back to the finish as quick as possible as the 2 hours was nearly up (we found out later that we were the only 8 hour team to get all the checkpoints for the mountain bike rogaine stage). Michael was pushing me from behind for parts of the ride along the road at the end to keep me moving fast and we came screaming into the finish but we were still a couple of minutes late. Worth it though for the points we made getting all the checkpoints. I pretty much wanted to lie down on the grass at this point!

<p>Awesome race but probably a bit short as we finished in 6 hours 30 minutes (probably should have been more like 6 hours without the mistake in the trek) but I was dead by the end anyway! 12 hour race next year?</p>

Did I mention we won?

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>The first event of the Australian Champs was the middle distance. From what I could see from old maps it was going to be steep and the notes seemed to indicate it was going to be quite rocky. It was even quite a ride up to the start (they even supplied us with little maps so we didn't get lost!) which was a good warmup (especially good because it was pretty cold).</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/i99KJ7PPYQNNfol-O5jUk-MKGV3fblsfhH2Vq7ageGY?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNn6g0T3BSI/AAAAAAAAEic/6pZETnBMxEA/s640/Aussie%20middle%2001.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
I mostly navigated okay but was a bit hesitant especially to start with when I saw one of the top Australians going down some very strange route (apparently she later blamed her bad time on mechanical issues...hmmmm). The terrain was extremely physical and you really didn't want to take the wrong track and go flying down a hill you weren't supposed to 'cause coming back up would be a killer.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoYfaNiXgI/AAAAAAAAEkQ/MUGJA8pMRjc/s400/IMG_5837.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Thanks Pete for snapping me in action as I leave the start</em></center> <br>
There was one bit where you could either go back out to the track along the single track you'd just come up or continue along it and although I figured it was probably slower to continue I thought it might be more fun so I went that way! I just kept imagining I was riding at Woodhill and thought of the rocks as the usual tree roots and it seemed to work quite well.

<p>I made a couple of mistakes near the end when I was pretty knackered. Somehow I ended up at #13 before #12 which I think happened to a few people. Then on the way to #14 I didn't see the track I was looking for and started off down the wrong one. Luckily I worked it out fairly quickly before I'd gone too far wrong! I was pretty happy with my race overall though.</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../mtbo_training_in_australia/">MTBO Training in Australia</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>After the weekend of racing over near Mt Gambia for the South Australian Champs we started making our way over to Maryborough and our base for a week of training.</p>

<p>On the Monday most of the team went for a trek up in <a href="http://www.thegrampians.com.au/">The Grampians</a> but because I was supposed to be looking after my foot I joined Di (or "camp mother") to cycling the <a href="http://www.cometolifeballarat.com/visit/getting-to-and-around-ballarat/scenic-bike-rides/ballarat-to-skipton-rail-trail.aspx">rail trail</a> going from Skipton to Ballarat. Okay, most normal people would ride it going the other way for obvious reasons once you get on it (umm, going the way we did it was mostly uphill the whole way) but why opt for the easy option?! Okay, it didn't fit with our travel plans to do it the other direction and, well, Di didn't tell me it was going to be mostly uphill. Rob and her sold it to me as a chance to spin my legs and relax. Umm, not unless you count relaxing as riding about 65km and most of that uphill (it's not a steep gradient but the ground is pretty sandy so there is quite a bit of resistance)!</p>

<p>Anyway, it was pretty awesome but very tiring. Di took heaps of photos but I haven't got them off her yet. I'll post some when I get them because the scenery was beautiful.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXBXRBktI/AAAAAAAAEgU/ob1r2OvsJrI/s400/IMG_4450.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
About 10km before the end of the trail (we kept riding into Ballarat to meet our driver afterwards) a magpie came out of nowhere and nearly knocked me off my bike which was quite hilerious especially after we saw it flap off rather drunkenly. Afterwards we discovered you could see where it had wedged its beak in my helmet.

<p>Tuesday was our first official day of training and I was exhausted! Thankfully the map was relatively flat (note the word relatively). We spent most of the day out riding the forest doing various different exercises focusing on smooth transitions through track junctions (i.e. not stopping to check the map every time).</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/PPb54kD1Uo2qocBGOG0Z1uMKGV3fblsfhH2Vq7ageGY?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoS3gOYuzI/AAAAAAAAEjI/TLqEZbMNOME/s640/Bull%20Gully%20Wells.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
The bush was quite dry and tracks were covered in twigs and leaves. Oh, and rocks. The terrain is definitely more rocky than anywhere I've biked in New Zealand and rocks are hard as I would find out the following weekend!

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXDcgF15I/AAAAAAAAEgY/91wMOgc0Rcg/s400/IMG_4478.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Wednesday's map was a lot steeper which generally suits me. In the morning we rode out round training loops in pairs and I was with Marquita who is, like, incredible (she has several World Champs under her belt). It was really cool to ride with her and I was feeling a lot more confident in my riding by the end.

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/YVtXAqODYD4rVr2BRDMtb-MKGV3fblsfhH2Vq7ageGY?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoS7_G9n8I/AAAAAAAAEjM/9ltNDPvrnT8/s640/Creswick%20Forest.jpg" alt="" title=""></a>

After lunch we headed out on some long legs by ourselves and although we were on the same map (although on the other side of it) the terrain felt really different. It was even steeper than the morning's training too but the forest was awesome.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoYX5LFHnI/AAAAAAAAEj8/AYENnLLPR70/s400/IMG_4497.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Thursday was the final day of training before heading over to Daylesford for the weekend. We were back over on terrain similar to Tuesday and started off with a relocation exercise. We were in groups and rode out into the forest not looking at our maps. When the leader of the group stopped we then had to work out where we were. Argh!! I'd never (hopefully) lose that much contact with the map so it was really tough but good fun.

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NzCBcuYSfCvflSZ8FKJpn-MKGV3fblsfhH2Vq7ageGY?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoTBNu6OFI/AAAAAAAAEjQ/juyColDmPDc/s640/Mosquito%20Flat.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
On the second exercise (long legs and route choice) I was riding along minding my own business (well, reading my map on what looked like a relatively smooth piece of single track) when all of a sudden I looked up and saw my front wheel hit a rather large log. It wasn't a bad crash but rocks sure do cause a bit of blood loss. Thankfully I was not the guy who got a stick in his front wheel which threw him off and fractured his sternum and ribs. Not good.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoYZVcgHcI/AAAAAAAAEkA/_xqqDt84H4s/s400/IMG_4499.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
We then had a go at a sprint course which was a bit of a laugh especially at one point where there were a few of us riding round in circles getting ourselves horribly confused! Never let someone else put you off your original plan!

<p>In the afternoon a few of us drove out to <a href="http://www.parkweb.vic.gov.au/1park_display.cfm?park=123">Kooyoora State Park</a> to explore one of the most technical (foot) orienteering maps I've ever seen. Have a look at the map <a href="http://omaps.worldofo.com/index.php?id=27952">here</a>. It's crazy.</p>

We traveled most of the morning on Friday and arrived in Daylesford (well, we were staying in Hepburn Springs but it's just down the road) around lunchtime. After lunch Rob decided we'd go on a nice relaxing half an hour ride along the river. Um yeah. It turned into quite a long, epic ride with one of the guys even managing to fall down a 12 metre cliff (and come out with only a couple of broken tendons in his fingers...I couldn't believe he was even alive!).

<em>Track closed? No problem, just ride it anyway. Apparently it said no riding either but never mind!</em></p>

            <p></p><p>Oh my god, worst race of my life!! It was a freezing cold morning and after hearing wild stories of how tough the terrain was on this map last time I was not exactly feeling prepared. It started out okay, although I felt really slow and there were a few weird sections where it felt like tracks were either missing or just plain different from the map especially on the way to #2. Then I bumped into Marquita whilst looking for #3 and we came to the conclusion it wasn't in the right place when I spotted it through the bush. Frustrating.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/aMMAjojfBGvqHNBxz04WIOMKGV3fblsfhH2Vq7ageGY?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoSunnuvKI/AAAAAAAAEjE/JIEBp39MQoM/s640/SA%20middle.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
Then it got bad. I was having a lot of trouble breathing and the sand was just ridiculous. I was struggling up the hills and felt really dizzy at one point and somehow managed to completely loose contact with the map. Not good!

<p>Because I am stubborn, I got all the way out to #9 which is on the very far corner of the map, about as far from the finish as you could get, before deciding I couldn't continue. Of course, I still had to ride back which was a mission. Yeah, I could have finished but I really couldn't face the sand and fairly epic hills that looked like dominating the last section of the course and my breathing was starting to really hurt so it was my first ever DNF. I thought I'd feel bad about it or something but I kind of felt relieved that I'd been able to stop.</p>
