            <h1><a href="../../../../welcome-to-the-kitchen/">Welcome to the kitchen</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>When we were house hunting the kitchen was a big factor for me. In our previous flat it was in a separate room and consisted of one small bench and nothing else. It had awesome amounts of cupboard space but used to drive me crazy. Oh, and the fridge was in the laundry because the room was so awkwardly designed there was no real room for it in the kitchen. I like to cook and when people would come over they always tended to hover around in the kitchen rather than hang out in the lounge which seemed rather awkward.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dvw1CQAon0Q/U75RDoxVqqI/AAAAAAAAFuI/QbXJ48cu_HM/s500/kitchen-1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, our new kitchen is still small but only 2 or 3 years old and way more functional (and it has a dishwasher!!) plus the lounge, dining room and kitchen all open out into each other so not only is it more functional but it's also full of light (well, in summer when there's more daylight of course). I love it!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rlD294Lth3s/U75TCplA_JI/AAAAAAAAFuU/4nGLZcaZCMA/s640/kitchen-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, we are awaiting our EQC repairs so the kitchen will be getting a bit of a makeover (new paint - a brighter colour and, hopefully, a blackboard! We might get new lino as well but we'll see). But who knows when that will be. I'm not looking forward to it. We've already been through the EQC process as tenants and that was bad enough! At least our house only has minor damage. And, with the help (or perhaps despair?) of M's Mum who does interior design, M has let me choose some lovely bright yellow paint for the laundry (but maybe I can sneak it into some other places too...!).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-h7ydfVRmf6g/U75THK6fh5I/AAAAAAAAFuc/21CsiLLFM6k/s400/IMG_8821.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So what's cooking on the stove there? Well, we had friends over on Saturday night for some trip planning and I made (steamed) Christmas Pudding but being all in the moment I didn't take a photo so instead you get a picture of the same pudding but from Christmas lunch (which we had at our place and hence I was in charge so it was all vegan which was pretty exciting). The flames were even more effective this time as it was dark and we turned off all the lights for the full effect. Some of our friends had never experienced the flaming pudding before so there was much excitement!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VCuR3mO_sRQ/U75OvHN3yoI/AAAAAAAAFtw/qXr8DtERbZE/s500/xmas-pudding.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The recipe is a veganised version of the pudding my Mum has made for the last who knows how many years. I think she found it from a crock pot book. If anyone is interested in the recipe let me know and I'll put it up. It's delicious!</p>

            <p></p><p>Sometimes, if I'm lucky (and I'm lucky quite often!), M cooks dinner. Last week I was out running and he ate leftovers but then specially made me my own dinner (along with leftovers for lunch). I was so hungry there is no photo. But just imagine a delicious tofu stirfry on rice. Can't go wrong with that.</p>

<p>Another night he made an Indian curry with <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/product/chicken-style-strips/">Frys vegetarian chicken strips</a>. Delicious! Well, apart from being a bit too hot for me to handle!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fDTTxTHKi3k/U5qHmrUtwAI/AAAAAAAAFo4/QvFRZshB61k/s400/chickenindian.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Then a couple of weeks back M also made pizza!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-L1NSOIOsisQ/U6AW1sV1KsI/AAAAAAAAFpo/L8jazZWGBxo/s400/IMG_8677.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The dough was homemade (I love having a breadmaker!) and was topped with tomato paste, red onion, courgette, red capsicum, capers, tomato, tofu sausages and hummus. Hummus on pizza makes an excellent cheese substitute (it works best with plain hummus and don't be afraid to use heaps of it).</p>

<p>And last night he made me another tofu stirfry before we sat on the couch geeking out over rogaine maps.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eIsRgZk0mik/U6AWLQCY0rI/AAAAAAAAFpQ/kHRGnkofQy8/s400/tofu.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">I love how it looks like a piece of carrot is trying to escape off the plate!</p>

<p>These are actually just a few of the meals M has cooked lately so basically I'm rather lucky!</p>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Up in Auckland there is a cafe called <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews/raw-power-cafe-auckland-401">Raw Power</a> that I used to go to when I was in town. I loved all their food but my personal favourite (when I could drag myself away from the chocolate cake) was their vegan melting moments filled with delicious passionfruit icing.</p>

<p>Because I no longer have access to their delicious cookies I have to make them myself and I've found the good old Edmonds Cookbook will start you off in the right direction. Whip up a batch of their <a href="http://www.edmondscooking.co.nz/recipe-1/melting-moments">melting moments</a> cookies (using olivani instead of butter - make sure you mix the mixture quite a bit until it really starts to stick together otherwise you'll find yourself cursing as you try and make balls out of the mixture and it sticks to your hands and basically makes you all round grumpy).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-FJjXWzGq4oc/U4g2d5INpCI/AAAAAAAAFoA/iYW_imZwTyo/s400/mm-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Once the cookies are cooled it's time to make delicious passionfruit icing! Soften about 60-70g of olivani (or other vegan butter substitute) and then whip that up with about 1 1/2 cups of sifted icing sugar until all mixed together and fluffy. Add some passionfruit syrup (or if you're super lucky, some passionfruit pulp but I've never been that lucky) to taste (quite a lot if you're using syrup) and voila!</p>

<p>Put dollops of the mixture sandwiched between 2 of the cookies and you've got yourself a serious treat.</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../eating-salad/">Eating salad</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>I've never been a salad fan and although I would eat it I general wouldn't have gone out of my way to make one. So I don't know what changed but this summer I've been in to salads in a big way. Most days at work I have salad for lunch which I make up in the morning and sometimes I'll make one on the side for dinner as well.</p>

<p>Here's Friday night's lazy dinner of salad and 'cheese on toast' (well on the delicious ciabatta buns they sell at our local New World). This is the blue Redwood Cheezly one. I've taken to ordering several different cheeses online from <a href="http://www.thecrueltyfreeshop.co.nz/">The Cruelty Free Shop</a> up in Auckland every now and then. My favourite is still the Sheese smoked cheddar but the Vegusto ones are pretty good. I'm looking forward to trying <a href="http://www.angelfood.co.nz">Angel Food</a>'s new cheese next time.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-o-EwMXTU0oI/U4GVCl3ZhCI/AAAAAAAAFnk/6s5veZmAAMo/s640/salad%252Bcheese.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, I got sidetracked! Right, where was I? Oh, salad. Right. Friday's salad consisted of spinach (not baby spinach but good old spinach - probably my favourite salad green - I chop it up so you don't get big leaves which I don't really like), grated carrot, capsicum, tomatoes, pepperdews (sweet piquanté peppers), sundried tomatoes, dates, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds. Delicious! The dressing was our favourite Chermoula Dressing from the first <a href="http://www.revive.co.nz/info/revive-home/the-revive-cafe-cookbook">Revive cookbook</a>. I really like this dressing but you don't want to spill it on your clothes because it stains pretty bad (all the tumeric and cumin in it).</p>

<p>Today, after a morning ride on the tandem, we were in need of something to, umm, snack on whilst we caught up on the Giro action (M has turned me into a cycling addict). For some unknown reason I decided that I would try making the Peanut Butter Blondies that I'd seen on <a href="http://www.neverhomemaker.com/2014/05/healthy-peanut-butter-blondies.html">Neverhomemaker</a>. I say 'for some unknown reason' because normally I would turn my nose up at baking something sweet that contained a can of beans or chickpeas.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nZ1VPMv4W9M/U4GVYplk_aI/AAAAAAAAFns/midKd5H7Uj8/s400/blondie.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, it was made and we ate it and it wasn't too bad! Probably quite good really! I think I would make it again for lunches and stuff but not for something special. Yummy but tasted a bit too <em>healthy!!</em></p>

Not exactly surprising considering it basically has an entire large block of chocolate in the icing! </p><p>After the usual wintery Wednesday Night run (basically a group of us meet up on a Wednesday night to go running in the Port Hills together) M and I tempted everyone back to where we were staying to help devour the cake.

- <em>Dead Reckoning</em> by Charlaine Harris</span></p>

<p>So how did I spend the first part of my "summer" holiday (which feels like a lifetime ago now)? Well last Christmas M and I went <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.co.nz/2011/01/paddling-for-food.html">kayaking in the Queen Charlotte Sound</a> which was amazing so this year a group of us decided we were going to kayak in the neighbouring sound, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelorus_Sound">Pelorus Sound</a>. The 4-day trip turned into a 5-day trip when the weather went from wet to wild and we were trapped (we did attempt to paddle back but it became apparent there was no way that was going to happen). The days were long and hard and I ended up very sick by the morning of the fourth day. It was quite an experience!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-CWQyAf2R7mM/T0nkv1S_MXI/AAAAAAAAFQQ/D1_-oLVfskw/s640/kayak02.jpg" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>So much gear to pack!</em>

<em>The views are incredible in the Pelorus Sound. It's breathtaking.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-lFq0_B0JFb4/T0nkxt5FVYI/AAAAAAAAFQg/KM-tGd-uFG8/s640/kayak04.jpg" alt="">
<em>Food...food is good. Over half the party was vegetarian or vegan so we all cooked together. When you're kayaking you can take heaps of stuff so we had tinned beans, heaps of fresh vegetables, wraps, tofu, pasta, wraps, rice...epic amounts of food. Turned out to be fortunate as we couldn't get back in on the last day and had to stay out an extra night.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sn8I3FguQ30/T0nkzLXa9rI/AAAAAAAAFQo/6GAKH9QDFKE/s640/kayak01.jpg" alt="">
<em>So the boys decided we were going to portage (meaning carry the kayaks) over the bank. You can see that it wasn't exactly flat. In fact on the other side it was more of a sheer drop!</em></p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-psqtRBX-5Y8/T0nk0pL9__I/AAAAAAAAFQw/h5OcATO8vXg/s640/kayak03.jpg" alt="">
<em>It rained so hard during the second night that our campsite was flooded out in the middle of the night and we had to (carefully) move our tents in the dark. By daylight the water was at least up to my ankles and deeper in places.</em></p>
