- </span></span><em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sophie’s World</span></span></em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> by Jostein Gaarder</span>
<span> <br>
M and I moved house last weekend so now we have somewhere of our own which is terribly exciting. I mean, I have a fancy big fridge all to us and a kitchen that I can arrange any way that I like! And, at last, my cooking inspiration is slowly starting to come back again after what feels like forever (months? Years even?).</span></span></p>

<p>But our first meal at the new place was Hell pizza on the only furniture we’d moved at that stage...a table with a couple of chairs! I like to customise the Sinister pizza (which is naturally vegan but mixing the toppings up a little is always fun) and if you get the big one then you have leftovers for the following night when you’re too tired from moving to even contemplate cooking something proper.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Wr4V639eTgU/Thjmfnva3rI/AAAAAAAAFHk/HseCnL8ZQXg/s400/IMG_2076.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The first meal I actually cooked though was pretty boring but still delicious, tofu stir-fry with turkish bread. Always a good safe option especially when getting used to a new kitchen.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TsBYltuXovg/ThjmhNEErEI/AAAAAAAAFHo/WIAmRaG5O8c/s400/IMG_2086.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I think I spent half the time trying to remember where I'd put everything and getting used to the fridge being in the laundry. Sounds weird but it actually works fine and that means we have more space in the kitchen.

<p>Next up is a rice and veggie casserole which is based on the Cheezy Broccoli and Rice Casserole from The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook. I liked the concept of this and the taste was pretty awesome too but there was far too much rice to veggies even though I had added more veggies than the recipe originally said. Although I didn't have a cup measure and I think the cup I used for the rice was, well, definitely larger than your average! But still, it definitely needs some modification to reach a level of awesomeness!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-adJPPuq_mOw/Thjmi-8pboI/AAAAAAAAFHs/0PbSaTTMBbo/s400/IMG_2087.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yes, it looks quite good in the photo above but the veggies (and beans) are all on the top and the rice is all underneath in a thick mass.

<p>Another night I made a delicious wintery scone-topped casserole (you can tell it's pretty wintery round here by these last two dishes...-3 the other morning when we biked to work!). This has to be one of my favourite winter dishes and you can make it with pretty much anything you have on hand.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EvWu4E4-hrM/Thjmm8fmbcI/AAAAAAAAFH4/5Vd_So0Pn_s/s400/IMG_2095.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The casserole part of this dish has onion, carrot, cauliflower, celery, pumpkin and tinned sweetcorn with a tin of butter beans and a creamy sauce (pretty much just oat milk, flour and sweet chilli sauce). You cook all that up then dollop spoonfuls of scone mixture on top and bake for about 15 minutes at a super hot temperature. Voila, an awesome winter dish that is also brilliant the next day or even frozen.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L5-ckzjRoAo/ThjmoE5aQLI/AAAAAAAAFH8/OWcR_BlRjgA/s400/IMG_2097.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, that's enough food for now. I am so tired! It's been so busy since moving and last night we had M's parents over for an awesome feast (which I will blog about shortly) and today we went for a lovely bike ride (route is </span></span><a href="http://nz.mapometer.com/en/cycling/route_1375407.html"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>) so I feel about ready to fall asleep on my seat. I wish we had a couch!

<p>Oh, and for anyone interested, our new flat is in the white zone which means it hasn’t been assessed yet but I can’t see any reason for it to be classed as orange or red so I think we’re pretty safe. It’s got the usual cracks that every house in this city now has but it all seems pretty superficial. If you are interested, there is more information about the zones </p></span></span><a href="http://www.landcheck.org.nz/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>. It is about whether the land is safe to live on rather than whether the structures themselves are safe (that’s different again - but appears to have a similar colour scheme as far as I can tell).</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span><span style="font-size:x-small;">So many thoughts scrambled for the emergency exit in Moist's brain that only one remained. <br>
- </span></span><em><span><span style="font-size:x-small;">Making Money</span></span></em><span><span><span style="font-size:x-small;"> by Terry Pratchett</span></span></span></p>

<p>I have tried to write this post so many times but it never comes out right or I think no one would be interested or it just ends up so long and twisty that I give up. But in the end I thought perhaps you might be more interested than I thought or that at least sometimes it is helpful so say what you need to say (even if it bores everyone else to tears)...</p>

<p>Last Monday started out like any other day. It didn't stay that way however. It was just after 1pm when we got the first big earthquake (a 5.6 I think) which had us diving under our desks. It wasn't long after we'd all managed to calm down and get back to work again that the 6.3 struck. The sounds are the most frightening to me. The groaning and grumbling of the earthquake itself, the collective holding of breath (which has a sound presence that is impossible to explain), panicked screaming, the rattling of, well, everything...and then the silence. That small moment of time feels like a lifetime. Then everything else gets broken down into tiny segments of memories.</p>

<p>I remember the terrible smell of chlorine spilling out of the cracks that formed in the spa pool outside. I remember seeing the birds flying manically through the sky in all sorts of directions and in huge flocks. I remember eating handfuls of licorice allsorts that the boss had taken out of his freezer (and wondering why he would keep them in there), not caring they weren't vegan. I just wanted something.</p>

<p>I remember drinking fancy wine out of a fancy glass while sitting outside in my fluro bike jacket and my helmet.  I remember needing to use the bathroom but not knowing what I was supposed to do so just waiting and waiting. I remember our company director lifting my bike over the security fence which we couldn't get open because it needed power. I remember biking slowly through the park in an attempt to not to get sprayed by the liquefaction but wishing I could bike faster because I had visions of trees falling on me. I remember the dust and the queues of cars and getting lost on my way home when I found I couldn't take my usual route. I remember the poor lady at the traffic lights who spoke like someone had taken the bottom out of her world but that I just wanted to get away from her and the doom and gloom and get home.</p>

<p>I remember sitting in a doorframe near the front door at home worried about M because I couldn't get hold of him (despite knowing he would be fine) and holding my cellphone really tight in the hope that someone might magically realise I needed some company. And then just as it was becoming unbearable there was a knock on the door and our neighbour, who I'd never met, was there asking me if I was okay and if I wanted to come over to his house until people got home. I remember listening to his windup radio and being unable to sit still while he calmly cleaned up the mess in his kitchen.</p>

<p>I remember the relief to see familiar faces as everyone came home or popped over to make sure we were all okay. I remember the power coming on just after dark and sitting inside, still in my fluro jacket, watching the news on our warped television screen. I remember not wanting to be alone and wanting to keep everyone here I cared about in the room with me. I remember wondering how it was possible to be so tired but so unable to sleep. I remember crying and wondering why. I remember being alive. It was never in doubt that M and I would be okay but the magical feeling of surviving is amazing.</p>

<p>Anyway, in case you have managed to read down this far I do have something for you...on the day before the earthquakes I made myself an oatmeal cake for breakfast before going orienteering. It was super delicious, especially with soy yoghurt and because I am awesome I even have a recipe for you (based on the ones <a href="http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2010/11/11/check-out-my-oatmeal-cake/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>).</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-kIMy_T2IVK0/TfrtKRqcvfI/AAAAAAAAFHM/4eyiuMhO1tg/s400/IMG_2010.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
1/2 cup wholegrain oats <br>
a pinch of salt <br>
1/2 tsp cinnamon <br>
1/4 tsp ginger <br>
1/2 a banana, mashed <br>
3 Tbsp oat milk (well, any non-dairy milk) <br>
1/2 Tbsp oil <br>
1 Tbsp golden syrup <br>
2 Tbsp peanut butter (or other nut butter) <br>
1 small handful of chopped walnuts <br>
1 small handful raisins (or chopped dates or something similar if you don't like raisins)

<p>Preheat the oven to 190°C.</p>

<p>Combine the dry ingredients, then mix in the wet ingredients.</p>

<p>Spoon into a greased ramekin (about 1 cup I think) and cook for about 20-25 minutes until it's firm(ish).</p>

<p>Let sit for about 5 minutes then tip out onto your plate and hope for the best (you may need to run a knife around the side)!</p></span></span>

            <p></p><p><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">...either too many words to an idea or not enough furniture for the idea itself or somebody else's furniture; always a muddle and clutter of speech. <br>
- </span><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Towards Another Summer</span></em><span style="font-size: x-small;"> by Janet Frame</span>
<span> <br>
I am home alone tonight and it's all dark and cold outside. M is out of town for work and my other flatmate is, well, out somewhere. I don't really like being home alone even when it's light. It's not that I can't entertain myself. More that I just like to know there are other people around. I could do with some chocolate but there is none...very silly I know!!</span></span></p>

<p>Since I'm feeling a little down I'll tell you a little about a couple of my favourite meals that I've been having a lot since I got down here. I've always loved nachos (well, at least in the last few years) but the way I've made them has changed over time. I found <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/10/try-not-talking.html"><span><span>this old post </span></span></a><span><span>from 2008 where you can barely see the bean mix under all the vegan cheese! But here is a plate of nachos from the other week...and I think this is the best version so far.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-WzenRvUioKs/TdGtjdzEYZI/AAAAAAAAFEU/FrFrBe8M4ro/s400/IMG_1667.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Everyone else was having sour cream so I got a little jealous and thought I'd try some hummus instead and it worked really well!

<p>Another favourite is, well, a sandwich. Makes a great dinner when you fry up some tofu, spinach and mushrooms. Makes an even better dinner when you've been at the climbing wall for the last few hours, it's gotten super late and you are really hungry.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NHvEhBER448/Te8-DPmsWMI/AAAAAAAAFGs/eP9iZwQdXrE/s400/IMG_1796.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There is something about toasting the bread that takes it from being lunch food to super awesome dinner food...kind of weird but true.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rc00oB0tAyI/Te87oB5zckI/AAAAAAAAFGE/fEOl5pGkXus/s400/IMG_1815.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I have also had a lot of tofu (and veggie burger) sandwiches for lunch lately...well, especially since starting my new job last week. ARGH!!! Can't believe I have a job! But it has made life even more of a whirlwind of madness than it was before...but life is still amazing.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4PX0W5UZQUU/Te8_yKl1V3I/AAAAAAAAFG8/2IHTdBIgOfE/s400/IMG_1823.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

<span> <br>
Look! It's me! I'm still alive!</span></span></p>

<p>Seriously, I have all these half-finished posts that haven't made it up because, well, I've ended up super super busy. Life can do that to you sometimes.</p>

<p>On my bench at the moment I have a whole lot of lemon shortbread cookies cooling for our work morning tea tomorrow. We are having a British themed morning since it's Queens Birthday this long weekend in New Zealand (it's not actually the Queen's birthday since that's in April sometime I think, but this is when we celebrate it). No photos of them yet but they do taste super delicious even slightly warm and still a bit soft!</p>

<p>But I do have cookies for you today. Even a recipe. This is an adaption of a recipe my old flatmate would make all the time. She would try all these different versions and we'd all get to taste test them. I was feeling a little homesick the day I made these and it cheered me up thinking heaps.</p>

<p>Anyway, I also made them the day before this crazy 24 race (eventually there will be a post for this and many others <a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/">here</a> when i come up for air again) the weekend after I arrived so I could have something yummy to eat in between legs and to warm my heart when the rest of me was freezing (and grumpy)!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C6R6SPpRdFM/TedidQORo_I/AAAAAAAAFFo/FethbUeRFSk/s400/IMG_1711.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ate at least 10 on the first day of the race (and a few more on the following day although I was slightly over cookies by then).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TdGtj8DD3lI/AAAAAAAAFEY/FU8uOAwMZIE/s400/IMG_1681.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
</span></span><strong><span><span>HyunJin's Magical Cookies</span></span></strong><span><span> (my chocolate, walnut and sultana version) <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>I got about 24 quite large cookies out of this recipe...and they are far yummier than they look!</span></span></em><span><span>

<p>2/3 cup vegan margarine (I used olivani or whatever it's called) <br>
1 scant cup brown sugar <br>
2 Tbsp golden syrup <br>
1 1/2 cups flour <br>
1 1/2 cups oats <br>
1 1/2 tsp baking powder <br>
pinch of salt <br>
80g chopped walnuts <br>
1/2 cup sultanas (or raisins or currants or chopped dates etc) <br>
1/2 cup dark chocolate, chopped</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 170°C. Line a couple of trays with baking paper.</p>

<p>Slowly melt the margarine, sugar and golden syrup in a big pot over the stove. Take the pot off the heat and mix in the flour, oats, baking powder and salt. Stir in the walnuts, sultanas and chocolate.</p>

<p>Place spoonfuls of mixture onto the baking trays with a bit of space between each. Lightly flatten (not too much). Bake for, hmmm, about 12 minutes or something like that. Just don't overdo them. That's all!!</p>

<span><span> <br>
So many things to talk about!! But because I can't decide where to start we'll just focus on dinner last night...</span></span></p>

<p>M went to the fruit and veggie shop after work and came home with a huge bag of capsicums so naturally there was only one thing to do (okay fine, I’m sure there were lots of things we could have done but only one came to mind at that point), stuff them.</p>

<p>It turned out rather delicious so I thought I’d attempt to give you the recipe...but then I realised that my cooking method is very much the “bit of this” and “handful of that” approach so these amounts that I’ve made up below are probably hopelessly incorrect! Oh, and you end up with more mixture than required but then again you can always make more or just eat the mixture by itself. It's quite tasty.</p>

<li><p><span><span>4 capsicums, halved and de-seeded (we had a couple of large red ones and a couple of smaller yellow ones)</span></span><span><span>
Set some rice cooking with the sultanas (I used the rice cooker).</span></span></p></li>
</ul>

<p>In a frypan, heat some oil and fry the onion. Add the mushroom and cook for about a minute then add the cumin, paprika, coriander and basil and cook for another minute. Add the carrot and tomato and fry until almost cooked then add the chickpeas, spinach, pumpkin seeds and sweet chilli sauce. You can add salt and pepper at this stage too but we tend to add ours individually when dinner is served. Take off the heat.</p>

<p>Add the cooked rice mixture to the chickpea mixture and mix together. Spoon the mixture into the halved capsicums until basically overflowing (you can pile it quite high and press it in). Sprinkle some yeast flakes (savoury yeast) on the top of each one.</p>

<p>Bake in the oven at 200°C for about 25 minutes.</p>

<p>Eat.</p></div>

Sometimes all you feel like is a big, hearty dose of vegetables. It is a weird thing. You see, it doesn't feel like all that long ago that the only vegetables I liked were carrot sticks and frozen peas (yes, only if they were frozen!). In reality that was well over a decade ago but sometimes I don't feel very old and wonder where the time has gone. Nowadays though, I adore vegetables. If there is one thing that I crave it is a huge vegetable stirfry or similar.</span></span></p>

<p>What about carrot sticks (harking back to my childhood), grilled eggplant, wild rice and barley (care of my flatmate), panfried tofu and a mixture of in season stir-fried veggies to help with those cravings?</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TX8hcLjCU3I/AAAAAAAAE54/WDUZGtGEw38/s400/IMG_4651.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I think that photo is making me hungry just looking at it. Tragic and probably also a sign my breakfast just didn't cut it this morning.

<p>Most weeks my veggie box has had some kind of leafy green (various different types of kale, silverbeet, some other random one that I'd never heard of before and promptly forgot the name of but was delicious...) and I discovered my favourite way to cook them up was to chop them up and stirfry them with some onion and, maybe, some other vegetables I might have sitting around and served on a bed of brown rice. My new favourite comfort food.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Tb3VbiSuwZI/AAAAAAAAFDU/bQzal2nD6_o/s400/110320_203911.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
As you might have noticed from the last two photos, I also have been having a lot of plain (well, salt and pepper) panfried tofu. I think because so much has been going on and I've been a bit stressed plain food has been the kind of thing I've craved the most.

<p>Another way to get a whole heap of veggies is to whip up a curry...although with this one I think we ended up with too much coconut cream so it was super rich. I was eating leftovers for days afterwards though which was awesome.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Tb3WBKEuCqI/AAAAAAAAFDw/uL-u_j9c8Wk/s400/IMG_1577.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Oh, and in case you didn't know, leftover curry is also great on toast and you can mop up the extra sauce with bread. Delicious!

<p>How about a sandwich stuffed full of veggies and tofu? Especially good after a long mountain bike ride with some monster hills. Another good way to pack in those vegetables.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Tb3VyiCmWII/AAAAAAAAFDs/W1-MUEKylIw/s400/IMG_1517.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
A few weeks ago I was on a real sandwich kick and was making these pretty much every day. The thing that makes them even more awesome is chutney and my current favourite is sundried tomato and olive. Mum made a couple of different feijoa chutneys too (feijoa and ginger and feijoa and chilli) but I haven't opened them yet.

<p>Another sneaky, but delicious, way to get some veggies is in these awesome muffins from </p></span></span><a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/cookbook/"><span><span>The Damn Tasty Guide to Vegan Baking</span></span></a><span><span>. I use this book so much that it is falling apart and some pages have stuck together from when I've spilt stuff on it!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQ6O0v3y5eI/AAAAAAAAEtE/vNrSgzHUUe4/s400/IMG_0510.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
These are even more delicious slightly warmed with margarine and a salad. Ooo, this is making me want to bake up another batch!!</span></span>
