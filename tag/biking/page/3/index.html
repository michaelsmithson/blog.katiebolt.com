Right, well I'm nearly caught up at last (I've finally made it back to 2010 again)! As I mentioned </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/01/i-made-it.html"><span><span>before</span></span></a><span><span>, I spent a few days up north house-sitting (and animal sitting for their dog and 3 cats) at my mate's farm and making the most of their property to put in some training.</span></span></p>

<p>This is Jess.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o5qBrhDxI/AAAAAAAADOs/Uw1SjLjLUZY/s400/IMG_3205.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
She would join me on all my training sessions which was super cool 'cause when you're out in the middle of some thick bush with no cellphone coverage for several hours it's nice to have a bit of company. She's gorgeous but every time I tried to take a photo of her it came out terribly so you'll just have to take my word for how beautiful she is!

<p>Anyway, I ate pretty well when I was up there. I'm still on a huge salad obsession which is just perfect for this hot summer weather we've been having.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o5yqTqx7I/AAAAAAAADO8/9ihPJpQ6Al0/s400/IMG_3178.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Heaps of veges, half a can of mixed beans, hummus, balsamic salad dressing and crusty bread. Awesome. Unfortunately I couldn't find their grater so had to have carrot peels instead which takes awhile to do.

<p>You really can't go past a good salad sandwich especially with good bread.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o5zV9tNpI/AAAAAAAADPA/bYRtEL2-w5Y/s400/IMG_3181.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was some random Turkish garlic bread that you bake in the oven for a few minutes first. So good!

<p>Stir-fried veggies and tofu is another of my big favourite meals of the moment.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o50UDoaVI/AAAAAAAADPE/qSM6PpHB3WQ/s400/IMG_3186.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
With the increase in my training I've been trying to eat more carbs with dinner 'cause I'd been getting a bit lazy about it so I baked some kumara chunks to go with it.

<p>Yep, another tofu stir-fry!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o51dRaY9I/AAAAAAAADPI/plvTIB5hkAE/s400/IMG_3198.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Add a bit of peanut butter to my usual marinade (sweet chilli, tamari, sometimes a bit of hoisin sauce, garlic) and I'm in heaven!

<p>And another giant sandwich!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o52Ak_e_I/AAAAAAAADPM/gDfVD9KvVrs/s400/IMG_3202.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This one had pan-fried tofu slices along with all the salad stuff and I actually ate this for breakfast before an epic ride.

<p>I was also testing how my stomach coped with various flavours of clif bars during training in preparation for some long adventure races and rogaines in the future. It's important to test out this kind of thing </p></span></span><em><span><span>before</span></span></em><span><span> the race rather than on the day!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o53hqdAEI/AAAAAAAADPQ/Cl9495DEzw8/s400/IMG_3192.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I've used the Cool Mint Chocolate flavour before and that works well but the only other one there that was okay was the White Chocolate Macadamia one. The peanut butter ones felt too sticky which is fine to just enjoy but it didn't sit well in my stomach once I got moving again and were also harder to eat 'cause I had to chew more. Yeah, sounds a bit weird I know! The Chocolate Brownie PureFit bar is great though.</span></span>

Little girls dance as though they were born to seduce and wriggle across the floor with challenging looks and raised eyebrows. Even the old grannies test the water, but give up halfway, before the dance is over. The old magic is still there but they haven't got the stamina to see the dance out. <br>

<span><span> <br>
Happy New Year!!! I hope everyone had an awesome time and that the year ahead is full of promise. Mine was spent having the time of my life down in Gisborne at the </span></span><a href="http://www.rhythmandvines.co.nz/"><span><span>Rhythm &amp; Vines</span></span></a><span><span> music festival. Seriously, best new years ever with some of the most awesome people in the whole world. It's been a pretty rough year but I've made it through and found my feet. This year is going to be my year!</span></span></p>

<p>I've got a heap of photos and stories from Christmas and all that (although I forgot to take my camera to Gisborne so will have to grab the photos off my flatmates) but that will wait. Right now I'm up north house-sitting at my mates' farm. It's like a little slice of paradise.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6Mc93XJWI/AAAAAAAADM4/XmV6yTnCRq8/s400/IMG_3137.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I arrived late this morning and after lunch (how can you not love that view?)...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7zd0_-f1I/AAAAAAAADOI/82TY0QNKxAU/s400/IMG_3148.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...I went for a cruise round their own personal mountain bike park! Yep, the property is pretty big and has an expansive, steep patch of (mostly) pine forest filled with mountain bike tracks. It's even been mapped (we use their property a bit for mountain bike orienteering).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6MayxLn1I/AAAAAAAADM0/G0I9s_DvArY/s400/IMG_3131.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

After the ride it was time for a dip in the pool and a bit of a nap. Their cats seemed to think that was a good idea too...here's one of them lazing around in the study!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7znsxUBjI/AAAAAAAADOU/b29zNKG1gIk/s400/IMG_3146.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then in the evening it was time to whip up some dinner. Feeling a bit tired (I think I'm still in recovery from the rather epic new years and an equally epic drive back yesterday afternoon) I didn't really have the energy for anything too exciting.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7zfS4-i3I/AAAAAAAADOM/IZgPatEgj2E/s400/IMG_3171.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size:x-small;"><span>'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life!' <br>

<span><span> <br>
My final day in the garden city, Monday, dawned perfectly clear and fine so our mission was apparent...to climb outside at last! But first, breakfast...</span></span></p>

<p>We'd decided we were going to go back to <a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/">The Lotus Heart</a> to try out their breakfast menu. The sun was streaming in through the window by our table overlooking Cathedral Square and while we waited for our breakfast to be served I had a chai latte made with rice milk.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYprjd9mI/AAAAAAAAC7M/om6dkiOR6cQ/s400/IMG_2823.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Believe it or not I had never had french toast, vegan or not, until this morning. Once I tried to come here for brunch to order it but we missed brunch by about 10 minutes so today I was determined!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYrByC1RI/AAAAAAAAC7Q/FD4D_2H8sOY/s400/IMG_2825.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was so delicious - grainy bread for the french toast with caramalised bananas sandwiched in the middle and served with fresh fruit salad and maple syrup. It filled me up for hours. I'm going to have to learn how to make my own french toast now!

<p>After breakfast we let our food settle before I set off for a short run to stretch the legs and B biked round the block. We debated trying somewhere new for lunch but were running short on time so settled on going back to </p></span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=15666020981016691371&amp;q=soul+food,+christchurch"><span><span>Soul Food</span></span></a><span><span>. We both picked this delicious flavoured green tea drink to try...refreshing.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYtnLCZMI/AAAAAAAAC7Y/xZzZQkCUNCg/s400/IMG_2827.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was hoping they'd have a vegan BLT left but unfortunately we were obviously a bit late and the cafe had been super busy so there was none left so I ordered the vege burger (same as B ordered on Saturday) and salad instead.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYsSZxSoI/AAAAAAAAC7U/zWxDDh18nww/s400/IMG_2830.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Delicious (but not as good as the BLT). Why can't we have food like this easily accessible in Auckland? Or am I looking in all the wrong places?

<p>Anyway, after lunch we headed off to the Port Hills (the only real hills in Christchurch!) and to a patch of rock called Rapaki where we met up with one of B's climbing friends.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdtr6oe2I/AAAAAAAAC7g/7XXEaX9TU-w/s400/IMG_2917.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Climbing outside is quite different to climbing on a wall inside. For a start you can use anything you can as handholds or to put your feet but it isn't immediately obvious what you can use. We climbed fairly easy climbs since it was my first outdoor experience but it was still tough work as it was so different (and SO hot).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPd0VorA8I/AAAAAAAAC70/RNHm0Ijgbdo/s400/IMG_2890.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Look at that view off the side of the wall...it was such an amazing experience. I am totally doing this again (I've become seriously hooked on climbing).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdxI7XAyI/AAAAAAAAC7o/4C_-y4QpiFA/s400/IMG_2904.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
A glorious end to what was quite possibly one of the best weekends I've had in a long long time. As I hopped on the plane I was kind of wishing I didn't have to leave...although my body sure was glad to be able to resort to normal eating habits!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdyQZL7AI/AAAAAAAAC7s/2cXfNbO3d7A/s400/IMG_2843.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

<span><span> <br>
Sunday morning did not quite start off as planned (this being last Sunday, not today in case anyone was confused). We had planned to go to </span></span><a href="http://theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span> for brunch but it was closed. So off to the <a href="http://www.artscentre.org.nz/Weekend-market/marketsearch.asp">art centre market</a> it was for souvlaki from the Dimitri's stall instead! It might not be what I'd typically see as brunch food but you really can't go to Christchurch and not have a souvlaki.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYfFpCC0I/AAAAAAAAC6k/PZtG-bOj-Js/s400/IMG_2801.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yep, that's one HUGE falafel souvlaki because B made us both get doubles. Seriously could not finish this but it was delicious. We washed them down with fresh lemonade from the market whilst lazing in the sun. Awesome.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYgd_ioVI/AAAAAAAAC6o/rBEM5GnQFwo/s400/IMG_2802.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Once we got home we also might have snacked on some chocolate biscuits B had picked up from the supermarket...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYhrXvnsI/AAAAAAAAC6w/NfWpo2s-7f8/s400/IMG_2803.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Once brunch had settled (which took a hell of a long time!) we headed off to </span></span><a href="http://ecan.govt.nz/advice/recreation-and-parks/waimakariri-park/Pages/mcleans-island.aspx"><span><span>McLeans Island</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPd2BGDuGI/AAAAAAAAC74/gEisHgAGYeo/s400/IMG_2806.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
While B fitted in some mountain bike training I ran round the walking track and took the detour out to the river. I wish I'd had my camera out there as it was beautiful.

<p>Not much is open on a Sunday night in Christchurch but we did manage to find somewhere, the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thedux.co.nz/index.cfm/index.cfm/christchurch/home"><span><span>Dux de Lux</span></span></a><span><span>, which used to be a vegetarian restaurant/bar but has since added seafood to their menu. They still have a good selection of vegan options though. Both B and I picked options that we could share.

<p>My meal came with salad and I picked the rice and the carrot salads. Very tasty and I had to restrain myself from eating all of it whilst waiting for the rest of my meal to be served.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYi5AEfaI/AAAAAAAAC60/esOBtUdO6tM/s400/IMG_2811.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ordered the sweetcorn and vegetable fritters which came with a beetroot chutney.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYk_bg5KI/AAAAAAAAC68/V553WhePctA/s400/IMG_2815.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They were huge and delicious with a crunchy outside and a gooey, creamy inside and the chutney went really well. Filled the spot perfectly.

<p>B also picked the rice salad and also went with a couscous salad which we weren't fans of.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYj8c1qkI/AAAAAAAAC64/5i4HDjUk5BQ/s400/IMG_2813.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For his main B ordered the Indian curry which was served with rice, chapatti, raita and mango chutney.

The curry was pretty delicious and hearty but the chutney was best avoided...tasted like eating a really sweet mango jam which would be fine in some contexts but not this one.

<p>Because we were starving and getting quite good at ordering (and eating) WAY too much food, we also ordered some kumara fries on the side with sweet chilli sauce. I love kumara fries and we polished them all off despite being so full we couldn't move!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYnBxd3uI/AAAAAAAAC7E/CwyjvQCQrUU/s400/IMG_2819.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Because we hadn't had dessert (which was a requirement for the weekend challenge!) we made brownies (yes, crazy I know)!! Using an </span></span><a href="http://www.orgran.com/"><span><span>Orgran</span></span></a><span><span> Chocolate Muffin Mix, we followed the vegan version but used soy milk instead of water and added peanut butter and chopped chocolate (I think we got a bit carried away on the chocolate chopping front but hey, chocolate is all good) and then cooked it in a large square cake pan.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StTvkrJjpFI/AAAAAAAAC8A/3DYF1YJOAKk/s400/IMG_2821.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It turned out really well especially when served warm with </span></span><a href="http://www.icecream.co.nz/litelicks.cfm"><span><span>Lite Licks</span></span></a><span><span> Hokey Pokey ice cream. Just to state the obvious, I was ridiculously full after this again! Hmmm...perhaps the theme of the weekend?!</span></span></div>

The spring rains have definitely been making an appearance over the last few days. Unfortunately they haven't been strong enough to get all the mud off my car so I guess I'm going to have to give it a real wash shortly!</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, yesterday was an exciting mail day. Since I moved out of my old flat I have been without any tools for my bike and have been borrowing gear off my flatmate's Dad. Well, I finally got around to getting some of my own. We picked out a toolbox that has most of the stuff I need and ordered it off the web (good old <a href="https://www.torpedo7.co.nz/"><span><span>Torpedo7</span></span></a><span><span>...and it arrived yesterday!</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrqMfwKRuDI/AAAAAAAAC3k/j85o9vtpWr0/s400/IMG_2741.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also ordered a pump and a chain stay guard 'cause my other one went walking when I last took my bike in for a service but these things aren't quite exciting enough to warrant a photo so you'll just have to imagine them!

<p>Also, to make yesterday even more exciting, last night I met up with my darling cousin D for our (almost) weekly dinner at Food Alley. We are creatures of habit and always head straight for the Claypot place and always order the same dishes. Mine is the Tofu and Vegetable Claypot and it is truly awesome. Quite possibly my favourite meal EVER!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrqMXM2dlvI/AAAAAAAAC3g/ukrIPXVaG40/s400/IMG_2736.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yes, I've blogged about the claypot here before but it really is good! We also always get a freshly made juice each too...it's like this little routine we've got going. This time I picked a carrot, pineapple and apple juice. Divine.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrqMVqNI2cI/AAAAAAAAC3c/msCQxPWMZSk/s400/IMG_2734.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
So all in all, yesterday was a pretty good day...</span></span>

</span></div><span>Saturday was date night. After going to the gym then relaxing in the spa afterwards J and I headed off to </span></span><a href="http://www.ginas.co.nz/"><span><span>Gina's</span></span></a><span><span>, an Italian Pizza and Pasta restaurant that is famous for being very loud! I ordered their Alla Salute, a vegan pizza covered in garlic, onions, capers, artichoke, olives, basil, rocket and fresh chili.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Shn-apdRpPI/AAAAAAAACFs/ZDw5WEeziYU/s400/IMG_2182.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It was pretty yummy but I can make better pizzas at home...the atmosphere was pretty funny though.

<p>After dinner we headed up the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.skycityauckland.co.nz/Attractions/Skytower.html"><span><span>Sky Tower</span></span></a><span><span> to look over New Zealand's biggest city at night then ended the night with sorbet on Queen Street under some outdoor heating.

Delicious (and don't you just love the peacock they put on it? I'd started demolishing it before I remembered to take a photo).

<p>If you ever visit Auckland I will give you one word of warning, it is NOT cycle-friendly. In fact it's a total nightmare. J and I are pretty pro having something done about this so the opportunity to join the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-star-times/news/latest-news/2436755/Protesters-block-Auckland-Harbour-Bridge"><span><span>protest</span></span></a><span><span> about getting cycle and pedestrian lanes on the harbour bridge was a no brainer. The Auckland Harbour Bridge (</span></span><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10574333"><span><span>50 years old</span></span></a><span><span> this week) is what bridges the city to the North Shore. It's chaos during rush hour as there is no other feasible way across (other than ferries).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Shn-nKa4wuI/AAAAAAAACGA/XUPGV2nWorM/s400/IMG_2193.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Several thousand of us gathered on the city-side of the bridge hoping the Transport Agency would say yes and let us cross. Unfortunately they wouldn't budge in their decision but after the leader of the protest announced that we were not to use force but there wasn't enough police to hold everyone (try like 20 police officers just trying to make sure no one got run over!) the crowd pushed through onto the bridge ending up blocking every North-bound lane across.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Shn-i-Q3gwI/AAAAAAAACF0/XDUHofowfR4/s400/IMG_2202.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Oh my god the bridge is awesome! Okay, so I've driven over it countless times but it is nothing compared to crossing it on foot. The views of the harbour are incredible and it's pretty cool to see the structure up close. There are places where you can see all the way down to the water below. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ext/share.php?sid=79923102876&amp;h=TBQRU&amp;u=Qc5Gw">Here's</a> a video of the bridge crossing too.

Memorable quotes of the day have to be, "Let's burn fat, not oil" and "Less talk, more walk."

After the last couple of days you could be forgiven for thinking that Auckland is a city of protests with the Auckland Harbour Bridge protest on Sunday and the </span></span><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/super-auckland/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501110&amp;objectid=10574537"><span><span>Auckland Super City Hikoi</span></span></a><span><span> on Monday (hikoi being a Maori word meaning protest march or parade...more </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hikoi"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span> if you're interested).</span></span>
