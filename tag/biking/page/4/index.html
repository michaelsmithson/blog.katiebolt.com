<p>The "night before" tofu - my favourite satay tofu :)</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SdPNfMlxTtI/AAAAAAAACBo/sdjhGFPiDDk/s400/IMG_1957.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We were just getting off the ferry as the marathon started so I managed to get a shot of the tail-end of the runners making their way up the first of several hills (you can probably barely see them in this shot - like ants on the horizon).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SdPN1SPJBRI/AAAAAAAACB4/vu6n9-79UN0/s400/IMG_1958.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My </span></span><a href="http://www.thedual.co.nz/"><span><span>race</span></span></a><span><span> started an hour later up that very same hill. I found </span></span><a href="http://big-biscuit.blogspot.com/2009/03/motitapu-rangitoto-traverse.html"><span><span>this blog entry</span></span></a><span><span> about the race - pretty much sums it up really. I saw a few people tumble on the scoria on Rangitoto - it's very rough terrain over there.

<p>Anyway, the race was awesome but we were pretty exhausted afterwards and spent ages waiting for room on a ferry to get back so luckily for us my parents invited us over for a 3-course dinner so all we had to do was sit down and eat! Mum had made fresh bread for the entree, this sweet and sour tofu dish on rice for the main course, and a chocolate self-saucing pudding for dessert complete with soy ice cream (okay, J and I swung by the supermarket on the way to their house and picked up my favourite Lite Licks Hokey Pokey ice cream so she didn't make that but still...).</p>

<p>The "night after" tofu - sweet and sour tofu made by Mum!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SdpyH-Z5raI/AAAAAAAACCA/83_Pn_c9CaU/s400/IMGP2572.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Last week was rather crazy and exhausting but I did manage a dinner out with a good friend of mine at The Blue Bird.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SdPNhWZQ4QI/AAAAAAAACB0/zmk5IQLmkJU/s400/IMG_1977.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I got the Tropical Chickpea Curry on kumara ('cause I can't resist every time I go there even if the dish would be way better on rice or something else!).

<p>We had to save room for dessert of course...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SdPNgUBgsHI/AAAAAAAACBs/RaBmlRku17E/s400/IMG_1981.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'd love to tell you that both these dessert bowls were mine but alas, I had to share! They make an awesome apple crumble with soy ice cream.

<p>Nothing like a spot of mountain biking to put you in good spirits though...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sdp0iFjKoPI/AAAAAAAACCc/nAYvPw__zt4/s400/IMGP2604.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...or a delicious oaty slice filled with berries from Revel to brighten a day at work :)

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SdPNd8eYnsI/AAAAAAAACBk/Fa_VcpMlUYY/s400/IMG_1975.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size:x-small;">It's important to know that no one can give you self-confidence; nor can you give it to someone else. You can't inherit it or hand it on to your heirs. You can't borrow or steal it; nor can anyone take it from you. Confidence is something that only you can give yourself. <br>
- <em>The Confident Woman</em> by Marjorie Hansen Shaevitz</span></p>

<p>How do you fit training into an incredibly busy schedule? Well, you incorporate it into your daily commute (okay, not every day but once a week?). J meets me at Mt Eden and we run the rest of the way together. The best thing is some times I get to pass traffic. That's enough to keep you buzzing the whole way home.</p>

<p></p><center><iframe src="http://js.mapmyfitness.com/embed/blogview.html?r=c4733ce5dcdf6833beb34ad0b711ebfc&amp;u=m&amp;t=run" height="500px" width="350px" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>

<p>Of course, with all that training you've gotta have some good food to fuel you up. Training often doesn't leave us that much time to cook anything exciting during the week so nights with takeaways or eating out are always exciting. There's a food court near J's work in town that has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claypot">claypot</a>.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SY5tL0rBRxI/AAAAAAAABwI/LPK9LVBfGMk/s400/IMG_1608.JPG" alt="" title=""><br><em>What could be in here I wonder?</em></center>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SY5tUBL3bsI/AAAAAAAABwM/4zOvka74ur0/s400/IMG_1610.JPG" alt="" title=""></center>

<p>It's spicy tofu and vegetables on rice - one of my all time favourite dishes to have when we eat out. I love how the rice goes crispy on the edges of the pot!</p>

<p>Pizza is also awesome. Though nothing beats homemade pizza, <a href="https://hellpizza.co.nz/">Hell</a> is not too bad. Plus they do kumara chips which I can never pass up.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SY5tHc4JLoI/AAAAAAAABwE/lOcNkdZXQQY/s400/IMG_1605.JPG" alt="" title=""></center>

<p>Here is their vegan pizza, with the enticing name of Sinister, with added mushrooms and cashews served with kumara chips and sweet chilli sauce on the side. Awesome (and quick)! Of course, this only shows about half of what I ate. It's pretty easy to devour an entire snack-sized pizza especially when you've had a hard day.</p>

<p>Of course, I have been concocting the odd thing in the kitchen...cupcakes!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SZsZi1gfYzI/AAAAAAAABxA/fIZuvxxzZy0/s400/IMG_1649.JPG" alt="" title=""></center>

<p>These are based (<em>very</em> loosely) on the hazelnut cupcakes from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/vegancupcakes.html">VCTOTW</a>. They're more almond and coconut cupcakes with mocha vanilla mousse filling and a plain vanilla icing. I've never seen hazelnut meal in our shops and I didn't have the time to make my own so almond it was.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SZsZkeuduLI/AAAAAAAABxE/k_Gz9LI3_t8/s400/IMG_1659.JPG" alt="" title=""></center>

<p>Above is a terrible photo of the inside. We now have a whole lot of mousse in the freezer waiting to be eaten. Don't you love how battle-worn our kitchen bench looks?!</p>

<p>It's only a couple of days to go until the Taupo Relay and I'm already lacking in sleep. Since the grade we're entered in starts at 2am on Saturday I'm not exactly hopeful of catching it up before the race. I can't wait but it sure could get interesting with a <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/4851838a11.html">tropical cyclone</a> on its way!</p>

<p>Anyway, for those of you interested, we spent our Valentines day putting in some mountain bike training. Funny that!</p>

<span><span> <br>
I finally got back on Monday after 3 weeks in the South Island for Christmas and the </span></span><a href="http://www.oceania2009.co.nz/"><span><span>Oceania Orienteering Champs.</span></span></a><span><span></span></span></p>

<p>Christmas Day was spent with J's family in Christchurch where I had made another tofukey (this one much more successful than the last one) as well as another chocolate trifle for my contribution and flown everything down on the plane with me the night before.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW0n7pVYZoI/AAAAAAAABqU/VsPCEoIoDns/s400/IMG_1208.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We spent Boxing Day with lunch in town...how could one possibly pass up a souvlaki?

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW0n6iWYn3I/AAAAAAAABqQ/ptQewM21Te0/s400/IMG_1278.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then we headed off to Sumner Beach where we played in the sand digging tunnels and exploring the caves by the sea. It wasn't quite inviting enough for a swim although one of J's friends did go test the water out. He didn't stay long so I'm guessing that said something about the temperature!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW1R71kFsPI/AAAAAAAABrY/hweY9a8g5Do/s400/IMG_1289.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
One of J's relatives was celebrating her 60th birthday at a fancy restaurant just out of Ashburton so we got to dress up for the evening. I got a very fancy vegetable stack...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW0n5n7cbUI/AAAAAAAABqM/6h5aR29YR10/s400/IMG_1319.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and green apple sorbet in a brandy-snap basket among other delights.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW0n4jLMJUI/AAAAAAAABqI/gYLMTviOYSE/s400/IMG_1333.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Christchurch is probably New Zealand's most cycle-friendly city so we did quite a lot of biking around town in the perfect summer weather (which naturally arrived a couple of days after Christmas as usual...it pretty much always rains here on Christmas Day despite being apparently summer!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW1SHdvHqKI/AAAAAAAABrg/vM7q6HxFHSo/s400/IMG_1340.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Christchurch is a beautiful city with heaps of lush green parks and lovely gardens...but it's just so flat!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW1Sa5e3hRI/AAAAAAAABrk/BY7HLuwEQbw/s400/IMG_1339.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We also fitted in a fair amount of training with several events coming up in the new year. J was taken out for an epic bike ride over Okuku Pass into Lees Valley whilst I ran up to the top of the pass and back as the summer sun really began to beat down before moving the cars around to meet the riders at the other end.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW1S_zS8hMI/AAAAAAAABrs/VewRkAxWMqc/s400/IMG_1355.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
As I said before, Christchurch itself is really flat...but if you head out far enough into Canterbury you will find some pretty big hills as I discovered on my way up to the pass!

<p>J and I celebrated the new year with brunch at </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span>. We were a bit late to try out the breakfast menu (we got there after midday) so had to settle for lunch food. I got the Bengal Burger with fries ('cause who needs to be healthy on New Years Day and choose the salad?!). It was awesome...but I was starving by then so potentially anything would have done!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW0n33WeMcI/AAAAAAAABqE/TehxxxdL6Gc/s400/IMG_1388.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Did I mention that I got a new compass? It was my belated Christmas present from J and is truly awesome (sometimes I really am an orienteering geek)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SW1kvc2CQpI/AAAAAAAABsA/EzoZ_fbLd4s/s400/IMG_1575.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

<p>I'm feeling a little jaded this afternoon. Tomorrow night is our family Christmas party so I've spent pretty much all of today in the kitchen preparing some of the food for the evening...but you'll have to wait until next time to find out what's on the menu! Of course, before ending up in the kitchen we got up not long after 5am for the final spin class of the year complete with champagne and strawberries! Then it was home to have breakfast of last night's tofu scramble. What a way to start the day!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SUsjhWmjCpI/AAAAAAAABps/j5Vr75LyBxw/s400/IMG_1174.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; "><span><span>This is actually last night's dinner but hey, breakfast looked pretty much identical so deal with it.</span></span></span><span><span> <br>

</span></span></div><div><span><span>Anyway, on to more exciting things. Last Friday I got to meet Theresa from </span></span><a href="http://travelingvegan.blogspot.com/"><span><span>The Tropical Vegan</span></span></a><span><span> for lunch as she was visiting Auckland for a conference! Being my usual self I was a nervous as anything but, as usual, there was nothing to worry about!</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span>Meeting up in town meant the obvious place to go check out was Raw Power. Theresa ordered the Tofu Burger which I've talked about </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/05/in-honour-of-coldplay.html"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>. Despite being a fairly warm day, I had a craving for soup (needing comforting perhaps?!) so got their soup of the day, Curried Vegetable Soup served with focaccia bread and hummus. It was creamy and delicious. Washed down with one of their freshly made juices, it hit the spot perfectly.</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SUVhNQw66GI/AAAAAAAABf8/1SDbF3ZbyYI/s400/IMG_1160.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span>Since you can't really go past dessert if it's offered I got a Caramel and Date slice (or at least that's what I think it was but I couldn't even remember by the time I'd decided what I'd wanted let alone now, a few days later!). We took our treats to enjoy in the sun (you have to make the most of it round here sometimes!) in Albert Park across the road from the university.</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>

</span></span></div><div><span><span>That evening we drove up to our family beach house at Wai Kauri Bay to escape for the weekend and enjoy the fine weather. As usual we had to check out the </span></span><a href="http://www.matakanavillage.co.nz/farmmkt01.htm"><span><span>Matakana Farmer's Market</span></span></a><span><span> on Saturday morning which included an On Yer Bike chocolate smoothie which you were supposed to blend yourself by riding this stationary bike attached to the blender. Unfortunately no amount of pedaling was getting my smoothie blended...I must have broke it!</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>

</span></span></div><span><span>It may be summer now but that doesn't mean the water is warm and inviting for swimming but hey, all you gotta do is toughen up right? Anyway, after all the mountain biking in the hot sun, a little cold water never hurt anyone!

<p>On Sunday we had the unique opportunity to bike the nearly-completed <a href="http://www.northerngateway.co.nz/">Northern Gateway</a><span><span>, a new toll road North of Auckland bypassing the old route through Orewa and Waiwera. The motorway isn't scheduled to open until February next year but they opened the road for bikes (in the morning) and walkers (in the afternoon so they didn't get mowed down by us bikers!) for the day so we could get a closer look.</span></span></p>

<em>The Johnstone's Hill Tunnels</em></center>

<p>The new stretch of motorway is a pretty impressive feat of engineering combining design, engineering and attention to the environment (believe it or not!). The site of the motorway is home to native wildlife and special care were in place to minimise the impact on both flora and fauna along the route. The route crosses several main waterways and there are two eco-viaducts over some of the more sensitive areas.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/STxuZCU9QDI/AAAAAAAABe0/gL2f0NkLrbU/s400/IMGP2218.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Inside the Johnstone's Hill Tunnel</em></center>

<p>It was cool looking down the sides of the bridges to see lush plantlife rising up below and extensive revegetation is planned for other areas of the route.</p>

<em>Looking down the river towards Waiwera</em></center>

<p>My parents were walking the 14km round trip later in the day when it was so scorching hot that they got tar stuck to their shoes. They also got held up in huge traffic jams trying to get to and from the start of the motorway. The irony is of course that this motorway, designed to minimise traffic holdups, was causing them as curiosity got the better of everyone!</p>

</div>Last weekend J and I checked out the North Western cycle route for the first time. This route follows along beside the North Western motorway for over 10km and starts, as we discovered, about 100 metres from our apartment!</span></span></p><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span>We cycled out to Avondale and checked out the <a href="http://www.fullcycle.co.nz/avon.html">bike store</a> there (got some new socks and the sales guy convinced us we needed Merida gloves to match our Merida bikes instead of our Giant ones! So now I have half-finger baby pink ones to match my camelbak and <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/05/ooo-i-do-like-fridays.html">helmet</a>...but not the bright green of the bike!) then discovered it was well and truly lunch time and we had nothing with us to eat. Conveniently there was a cafe right next door so we went there. I ordered a custom pizza with mushrooms, capsicum, cashews and mango chutney. It was truly delicious (or perhaps that was because I was so hungry!) so perhaps we will have to cycle out that way at lunchtime more often! <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>

</span></span></div><div><span><span>The coolest thing about the cycle way is the section right next to the motorway where it crosses over the estuary and you're riding right next to the <a href="http://www.rodney.govt.nz/EnvironmentalCare/coastmarine/coastmarine/Documents/Mangroves.pdf">mangroves</a>. I've driven along this stretch of motorway in rush hour a few times and been extremely jealous of the cyclists and runners whizzing past so it was cool to finally experience it myself.</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/mWWSia10LbbDksEChwriEQ?authkey=i4-QTk9RVPQ"><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/goddessvaala/SNwALryMtfI/AAAAAAAABVc/ciTU1dw2jyQ/s400/IMGP2035.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></a></center></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span>I've always found mangroves to be pretty special...I love the way they grow up through the mud and when the tide comes in only the tips of the trees are visible. My brother once made a picture book about living in amongst the mangroves and I always imagine the drawings in his story coming to life whenever I see the mangroves rising up out of the mud. I do have to admit though I once did a rogaine where we ended up, well, very deep in mud amongst the mangroves and I can't honestly say at that point I found them very special at all!</span></span></div>
