<span><span> <br>
How come it feels so good to get home again and yet it sucks at the same time? Why do some of my most favourite people have to be so far away? And why does my backlog of photos never stop growing?! Oh well! We'll get there...eventually.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXBXRBktI/AAAAAAAAEgU/ob1r2OvsJrI/s400/IMG_4450.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, you might be pleased to know that I am still in one piece. I did not fall down a 12 metre cliff and neither did I get a stick through my front wheel and come off breaking my sternum or ribs. I left those adventures to others in the team!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXDcgF15I/AAAAAAAAEgY/91wMOgc0Rcg/s400/IMG_4478.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I did, however, ride for 25 hours (that's 9 days in a row of racing and training), get some wicked cuts and bruises from crashing into rocks, fell off my bike in a bog and got completely submerged and spent more than 2 hours cleaning the mud off my bike and shoes only to find NZ customs in a relaxed mood.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXIn9ZbwI/AAAAAAAAEgo/9FNZNpbWtYc/s400/IMG_4516.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I laughed so hard that I thought I might explode, got attacked by a magpie (seriously...you can see where the beak of the bird wedged into my helmet!), lazed in the spa pool and learnt more about bikes in 9 days than I ever had in the last 3 years of riding. When I finally get a chance, there'll be more info about the trip up </span></span><a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span> if anyone is interested.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXMbVzqRI/AAAAAAAAEgw/EQr6SjPrue0/s400/IMG_4558.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Oh, and I also managed to eat some pretty good food. I didn't photograph most of it (like the awesome vegan lasagnas that got whipped up for us non-meat eaters one night) because I am a bit slack but rest assured, you will not go hungry even in small towns in Australia (I found tofu, both plain and marinated, veggie burgers, oat milk and all sorts of other staples in every supermarket I went to).

<p>This is the only photo of food that we actually cooked. This was our second night in Mt Gambia and there were three of us girls cooking together in our little unit. We were lazy and bought pre-prepared stir-fry veggies since we were traveling the next day.</p>

<p></p></span></span> <center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNQ7DudGI/AAAAAAAAEfo/uQSlwGWZ614/s400/IMG_4431.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Next stop was a farmstay not far out of Carisbrook. It had the most awesome kitchen where we would cook up communal meals each night. Down the road in Marybourgh there was a cafe (Legendz) that could make soy milkshakes. After a hot day out in the forest I couldn't think of anything better!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXE3xbtrI/AAAAAAAAEgc/W8wQzCpvsB0/s400/IMG_4488.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It was thick, cold and delicious...and I drunk it so fast that I got a headache!

<p>Food-wise, Daylseford was when it got exciting. We'd just arrived and were mulling around town whist some people were sussing out somewhere good for coffee when one of my team mates spotted a sign outside one of the cafes saying it was vegetarian and vegan.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNS7rlX6I/AAAAAAAAEfs/mKhigXafMxQ/s400/IMG_4528.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My first trip (we went twice) to the </span></span><a href="http://www.himalayabakery.com/"><span><span>Himalaya Bakery</span></span></a><span><span> I got a mini chocolate cake and organic cola.

<p>I also got an apple and cinnimon scroll to take away with me too (oh, and later on I got one to eat on the plane home too...they were big and deliciously filling).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNUqg-zII/AAAAAAAAEfw/TV0Xy4pz3XE/s400/IMG_4529.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Our first night we all went out to dinner at the </span></span><a href="http://oldhepburnhotel.com.au/"><span><span>Old Hepburn Hotel</span></span></a><span><span>. I got a veganised version of the vegetable and kidney bean nachos which was pretty good but I could have done with more bean mix and less corn chips. It didn't last all that long though (riding every day makes you hungry...and incredibly tipsy on one bottle of alcoholic ginger beer and therefore your table's entertainment for the evening)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNWrrtZZI/AAAAAAAAEf0/A52NQuiIJqw/s400/IMG_4563.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Saturday night was the social function at a pub down the road. Food was catered but I'd organised in advance for a meal to be provided for me. They ended up changing their vegetarian dish to make it vegan which I thought was pretty cool...green curry with tofu and tempeh. Not anything flash or amazing but it filled me up and, quite frankly, I was hungry so as long as it was edible I wasn't really fussed.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNYJcALtI/AAAAAAAAEf4/1BELSCXHRsI/s400/IMG_4571.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And for dessert they served me a big bowl filled with grapes and strawberries. Everyone else at my table was jealous and I had to fight them off!

<p>After our final race we went into town again for lunch and boy did I need food by then...desperately (after nearly 3 hours of mountain biking I was pretty desperate)! I managed to convince over half the team to join me at the Himalaya Bakery again! Everyone had to agree the food was really good.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNaBORMtI/AAAAAAAAEf8/l42OY8L07DU/s400/IMG_4573.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I got the open veggie burger (I think it was made from lentils). It was good. So basically, if you find yourself near </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=daylesford,+australia&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Daylesford+VIC,+Australia&amp;ei=CjzJTO-aL8-1cPmViDM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA"><span><span>Daylesford</span></span></a><span><span>, go here. I really recommend it.

<p>For our final night we went out to the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.ballarat.com/jasminethai/index.htm"><span><span>Jasmine Thai Restaurant</span></span></a><span><span> in Hepburn Springs. Items on the menu that could be veganised were clearly labelled which was super cool and my meal was delicious. Of course I was pretty forgetful that evening and forgot my camera again. Typical...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXNrm14TI/AAAAAAAAEg0/Zd7kz2nI7mo/s400/IMG_4575.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...but after over 2 hours of cleaning my bike and bike shoes (I don't think either have ever been this clean since they were brand new - look how sparkly it is!) I was completely exhausted.

<p>So all in all it was an awesome trip (and this is a ridiculously long post). Plans are already underway for next year...</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
I go to Australia at the end of this week! I would be excited except for the fact that I'm terrified. You see, this is what happened last weekend when I was out training...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKfnHOUqvgI/AAAAAAAAEeE/NEDZX4WV918/s400/IMG_4362.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and I'd had to climb up several metres in order to take this photo! The general consensus among some of my friends is that my mountain bike has gotten jealous of my road bike and decided it would throw me off just to make sure I knew who was boss. I ended up with mild concussion and head trauma. Thanks.

<p>Anyway, we will worry about the racing when I get there and instead I will show you the delicious dinner party I had with a couple of friends the other night.</p>

<p>J made some awesome roast veggies (kumara, potato, carrot and pumpkin). You can't really go wrong there.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pdYZlYwI/AAAAAAAAEfA/UC-o4Uv89_c/s400/IMG_4343.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Our beautiful host made a big pot of vermicelli noodle stir-fry with heaps of veggies and flavoured with soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pe_CbNSI/AAAAAAAAEfE/KI8H_eGdqdc/s400/IMG_4344.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here is my plate (oh okay, my first plate 'cause let's be honest, it was really good and I was really hungry).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pglVnGcI/AAAAAAAAEfI/ylSAb6XDoHQ/s400/IMG_4345.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was in charge of dessert and after wondering what to make for ages I ended up making the </span></span><a href="http://veganzestforlife.blogspot.com/2010/09/caramel-cream-pie-oo-la-la.html"><span><span>Caramel Cream Pie</span></span></a><span><span> from Alice's </span></span><a href="http://veganzestforlife.blogspot.com/"><span><span>blog</span></span></a><span><span>. You see, I'd had a tin of this soy condensed milk and a packet of the soyatoo cream sitting around in my pantry for ages with no idea of what to do with them (does anyone else see something new and exciting and buy it without any thought of how on earth they might use it?) so this was pretty much perfect.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKW43piSoHI/AAAAAAAAEds/0Vdn0BPeHFg/s400/IMG_4350.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Next time I think I'd double the amount of caramel filling and half the amount of cream topping but otherwise it was really delicious and simple to make (which is always a bonus when you're running late after your bike gets a puncture on your training ride after you've already got lost and have been out way longer than anticipated as it is).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKW44gNQ9WI/AAAAAAAAEdw/97Tb-hzGVsw/s400/IMG_4353.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Looking forward to doing it all again when I get back. We already have the date scheduled!</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size:x-small;"><span>"You must keep your feet grounded so firmly on the earth that it's like you have four legs, instead of two. That way, you can stay in the world. But you must stop looking at the world through your head. You must look through your heart instead." <br>
- </span></span><em><span style="font-size:x-small;"><span>Eat, Pray, Love</span></span></em><span style="font-size:x-small;"><span> by Elizabeth Gilbert</span></span>
<span><span> <br>
As I said in my last post, I had a friend come visit me for the weekend...after picking M up from the airport we thought we'd go roam the supermarket because that's what people </span></span><em><span><span>do</span></span></em><span><span> on a Thursday night right? Amongst other random buys (chocolate was the essential reason for the supermarket trip) I discovered this packet of chips in the International isle. I mean, how could you possibly pass up a flavour of chips called Mrs H.S. Ball's Chutney? What could possibly be more appealing?!</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TIQngEBjTzI/AAAAAAAAEPM/9ebqtK_STx8/s400/IMG_4154.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We ate them all on the car ride home. Of course, this might indicate that they were delicious or something. Rather they were weirdly sweet (well, they were chutney flavoured after all) but awfully addictive...if that makes any sense.

<p>We went out for breakfast but I didn't take my camera which was pretty slack but in my defense we actually weren't planning on breakfast (well, we were...just not right then). Because neither of us checked out the address of our morning destination carefully enough we had to postpone morning plans till later and go eat before I turned into a monster. So we went to Raw Power since we were in town and I had their tofu scramble. It's really good...but clearly camera-shy because every time I've had it my camera has, well, not been there. Oh, and we may have had a giant melting moment cookie as well but that might just be a rumour.</p>

<p>I do, however, have a photo of lunch...which isn't exactly pretty but still tasted good. I suspect that after biking out to Kumeu most things would have tasted quite good though.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TIQnjZ5CmKI/AAAAAAAAEPU/-UVopsbgxKM/s400/P1000366.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We had to retreat to a bus stop to hide from the wind and rain. Typical Auckland (there was blue sky in the morning, then it rained, then it was blue sky again...repeat until you get exhausted...but the weather never does).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TIRGRUbpBNI/AAAAAAAAEQU/V3K9I0O0pyY/s400/P1000388.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And then we biked home again...

<p>We were up at my beach house the next day (after arriving late at night from basking in the Waiwera Hot Pools until we turned all wrinkly) and for breakfast I made us both the Banana Flapjacks from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/vegan-brunch.html">Vegan Brunch</a>. They turned out really delicious (between the 2 of us we easily polished off the whole batch) but I really need a non-stick frypan because I was wrestling with the old cast iron one which was determined to destroy all remnants of a good mood. Luckily I'd given M prior warning that I was likely to turn into a monster when it came time to try and turn them over so he didn't panic when I started cursing.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TIQnaylux3I/AAAAAAAAEPA/B1yuVqiPuFQ/s400/IMG_4166.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Served with peanut butter (well, mine was anyway), blueberries, soy yogurt and golden syrup. Quite awesome.

<p>Fuel before heading up over the hill to the reserve for running drills...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TIQnh-_ZFZI/AAAAAAAAEPQ/n3VWMhwcwZ0/s400/IMG_4171.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is a muesli bar from my local bakery. They are awesome (the bakery specifically but also this muesli bar)...heaps of vegan options and if you are avoiding wheat or gluten, well you have quite a few choices too.

<p>I attempted to climb the predator fence in an attempt to get out of doing the drills but M was having none of it...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TIROUJYdsmI/AAAAAAAAEQw/ZCJOqevpEkY/s400/P1000411.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...okay, who am I kidding?! You don't have to drag me out for </span></span><em><span><span>any</span></span></em><span><span> adventures (as for the predator fence, </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/tawharanui/"><span><span>Tawharanui</span></span></a><span><span> Reserve is a penninsula protected by what they call the predator fence to keep, well, predators out...turns out it keeps humans out too if you don't cross at the proper gates so I guess that makes us predators as well)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TIRGC6C11XI/AAAAAAAAEPw/rUrRveciRSE/s400/P1000413.JPG" alt="" title="">

By the time we got back it was after 4pm and we hadn't even had lunch! Emergency refueling was called for before I either passed out or turned into the monster from hell (is this a recurring theme for this post?)...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TIQncv8GJjI/AAAAAAAAEPE/cFabWX5si0g/s400/IMG_4178.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
A big bowl of stir-fried veggies and tofu sausages mixed in with a packet of curry/soup (it tried to claim it was both which was a bit confusing) and served with spelt toast smeared with my Mum's kumara and sundried tomato hummus. Oh, and a bottle of Phoenix Cola. Can't go wrong.

<p>And then it was time (well, after lazing on the couch and watching the news about the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/canterbury-earthquake/"><span><span>earthquake</span></span></a><span><span> in M's hometown which was a bit scary) to head back home which is always a bit sad. I'd like to stay up at my beach house forever.</span></span>

Life is amazing. Hell, even when it's tough it's still pretty amazing. Here are some cool things and great food in my life recently...</span></span></p>

<p>Ginger crunch.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGPBqVJhsGI/AAAAAAAAEEU/yF-Ys4fYC-8/s400/IMG_4000.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Even better is getting home from a long day at work to find a parcel sitting outside my bedroom door...a parcel containing my favourite ginger crunch all the way from <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/search?q=soul+food">Soul Food</a> in Christchurch. Awesome!

<p>Riding my bikes.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THc7rq-axtI/AAAAAAAAEN0/uBfD6lrJx5M/s400/IMG_4108.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is my new road bike (I've called her Ellie...interesting to note that my mountain bike is definitely male in my eyes but my road bike is a female)!!! She's shiny and fast!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THc7aE8SjkI/AAAAAAAAENg/79U8L5CQ8X4/s400/IMG_3163.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here's my mountain bike. He's strong and dependable...and is about to go on his first overseas adventure! I will admit there were times in the past when I was quite ready to throw him off the top of a cliff but these days we are quite good mates!

<p>Hot soup on a cold day.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoacUub-MI/AAAAAAAAD-s/gsFHsZFwCYs/s400/IMG_3830.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is one of the many vegan soups (Tuscan bean and vegetable to be exact) from the coffee shop across the road, </span></span><a href="http://www.viewauckland.co.nz/restaurants/agnes-curran-info-56668.html"><span><span>Agnes Curran</span></span></a><span><span>. They make all their soups and are now consciously thinking about the ingredients they use and let me know when they're vegan. Plus the staff there always make me laugh (I don't drink coffee but my boss does and I'm the one to go get it...they know me very well!).

Waikauri Bay is my favourite place and over the hill is </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/tawharanui/"><span><span>Tawharanui Regional Park</span></span></a><span><span> which I've been exploring all my life. Running over there never gets old. Even better is sharing the experience with a friend and we even had beautiful weather...in the middle of winter!

<p>Chocolate (I mean, how could it not be part of an awesome life)!!!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj564VMSI/AAAAAAAAEBo/WKA-ihp30Bk/s400/IMG_3975.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
That (above) is a Decadent Date from </span></span><a href="http://www.shechocolat.com/"><span><span>She Chocolat</span></span></a><span><span> in Christchurch (D bought me a whole bag as a present). It's described as a fresh organic medjool date hand stuffed with a gianduja filling and coated in the finest Belgian chocolate. Delicious!

<p>New running shoes (I don't know how fond I am of the bright pink colour of my new </p></span></span><a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/p/Womens/11/Mizuno_Ladies_Wave_Nirvana_6_Shoes/5360049181/"><span><span>Mizunos</span></span></a><span><span> though but I love <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/">Wiggle</a>!). Even better is getting new off road shoes and wearing them in (because I can't handle them being clean for long)! Below are my new </span></span><a href="http://www.inov-8.com/"><span><span>Inov-8</span></span></a><span><span> Roclite 285s 'cause my old ones are starting the slow trip to falling apart.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THw04kLATHI/AAAAAAAAEOM/ZzQwtu4lDMs/s400/IMG_4140.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The only thing that makes that experience even cooler is testing them out in the </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/waitakere-ranges/"><span><span>Waitakere Ranges</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THw06ASEEEI/AAAAAAAAEOQ/zPDfEhhYPHA/s400/IMG_4141.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It is like paradise (but the weather is very temperamental out there so I'm always weary of taking my camera out with me...maybe next time).

<p>Eating lunch with A at </p></span></span><a href="http://www.kokako.co.nz/"><span><span>Kokako</span></span></a><span><span> and catching up on all the gossip and drama of his life...makes for a truly entertaining experience! It's just along from my gym so A is a bit of a celebrity whenever we go too!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TDKkm3GE8FI/AAAAAAAAD4s/8OTxJjg5Foo/s400/IMG_3719.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Plus the food there is good. Above we have the tofu scramble with their awesome veggie booster juice and below is the beans on toast (which isn't really beans on toast at all since they put the beans </span></span><em><span><span>next</span></span></em><span><span> to the toast but I can forgive them!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGPBlsLIbnI/AAAAAAAAEEE/5NAG8FCtyOU/s400/IMG_3981.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
As I was writing this I realised it could actually go on and on which is incredibly heartening!

<p>But one of the best things? Awesome friends coming to visit...I'm counting down the hours till I head out to the airport tonight!</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
Don't worry people, the maple syrup tofu recipe is coming!!!</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, welcome to my new favourite dinner. It's so good that Keisha stole half of one of my tofu sausages while I was getting a drink and then sat next to me giving me that look that only dogs can do! It is also so good that I'd already started eating it before I remembered to take a picture.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9YipKs7ZWI/AAAAAAAADpc/lENj0-6UiN0/s400/IMG_3520.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
So, we've got steamed broccoli, raw carrot with hummus, fried mushrooms, tofu sausages and awesome Maori potatoes that The Chef got me from work boiled and then lightly tossed in some olive oil and salt. I want it now!

<p>Other cool stuff coming out of my kitchen was this wicked lasagne. The Chef is on a no gluten, no dairy, no raw fruit or veggies diet for a month so instead of pasta we baked large slices of kumara and layered it with slices of courgette and a 'mince' mixture made from Tonzu tofu mince, black beans, a tin of tomatoes, onion, carrot and mushrooms. All topped off with a white/cheesy sauce and a sprinkling of pumpkin seeds then chucked in the oven.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S89mFjLU7SI/AAAAAAAADnM/w7nRNKu37vI/s400/IMG_3505.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We ate the leftover kumara slices with maple syrup while waiting for the lasagne to cook!!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S89mG6_v_DI/AAAAAAAADnQ/jQ-SlOykcn0/s400/IMG_3506.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It kind of fell apart when we served it but it still tasted really good. Once it had cooled though it held together quite well and tasted even better for my lunch the next day.

<p>As usual there has been plenty of action going on round here (other than in my kitchen of course). On Saturday I had a mountain bike race out at Riverhead...notorious for being a mudbath when it's been wet. So naturally it was raining that morning! Who could expect anything less?!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9S1J9EscXI/AAAAAAAADpI/oe7gsxXrCBg/s400/IMG_3510.JPG" alt="" title="">

<p></p></span></span><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9S1L0uhQUI/AAAAAAAADpM/JhF26YZSMDM/s400/IMG_3511.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It took me an hour to clean the bike once I got home and another half an hour to get the clay off the soles of my bike shoes. Seriously.

<p>I was starving after all that so whipped up a toasted sandwich with hummus, spinach, grated carrot, tofu sausages and melty </p></span></span><a href="http://www.redwoodfoods.es/cheezly.php"><span><span>Cheezly</span></span></a><span><span> vegan cheese. Lightly toast the bread, chuck in all your fillings and then brown over the frying pan on each side.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9S1grohV1I/AAAAAAAADpU/yg3pYpL9vhE/s400/IMG_3515.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Hit the spot perfectly.

<p>Oh yeah, and I also scored a mammoth bag of feijoas off a mate's tree. Awesome!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9S1h2jm_TI/AAAAAAAADpY/8mbAvq6X2IY/s400/IMG_3518.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

<span><span> <br>
I normally have Fridays off (unless it's chaos at work which has been happening of late) so that leaves me with a 3-day weekend...every week. Oh yeah!! This weekend was fueled by food (shouldn't they always be?)!</span></span></p>

<p>It all started on Friday lunchtime when The Chef and I met up with my awesome cousin D at <a href="http://www.revive.co.nz/"><span><span>Revive</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S3ZaMm6ORGI/AAAAAAAADW8/1nP1v-FHgIA/s400/IMG_3294.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I got the hotpot of the day (Urid Dahl with Spinach and Tofu "Paneer") and the Bangkok Slaw. Yeah I know, pretty much every time I go to Revive these days I end up getting the slaw but it's so good that I can't resist.

<p>Clearly on an 'eating out' run, we hit up </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thebluebird.co.nz/"><span><span>Blue Bird</span></span></a><span><span> for dinner that same day. I got the Hing Pie (rice and various veggies I think) with peanut sauce and salad.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S3ZaLRaM6VI/AAAAAAAADW4/lIh_eeqsA1Q/s400/IMG_3296.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Oh man, this was real good (hmmm, peanut sauce...how could I possibly resist!). I was also tempted by their chocolate cake but somehow (I don't know how) managed to resist...crazy!

<p>Then on Saturday we braved the drizzle and grey skies and hit the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.oratiafarmersmarket.co.nz/"><span><span>Oratia Farmers Market</span></span></a><span><span> in West Auckland. I love Farmers Markets but I don't go to them as often as I should. Actually, I haven't been to one in ages so it was all rather exciting!

<p>As well as getting a selection of stuff to make lunch and dinner we also got some (sweet) steamed cassava.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S3ZaOlzYB9I/AAAAAAAADXE/NilVqJPSsaU/s400/IMG_3301.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I think it is basically just cassava and sugar with coconut on the top but whatever it is, it's delicious! They also had steamed rice which was pretty good (rice, sugar, coconut) but this was the best.

<p>The Chef also bought me some nice New Zealand olive oil from one of the stalls. They had two different flavours...a grassy one and a peppery one. At first I liked the peppery one best but once that flavour hits the back of your throat (a few seconds later) it was a bit much so I went with the grassy flavour. It's amazing drizzled straight onto your salad (as long as you're not super clumsy like me and tip way too much on). The oil is made by a company called </p></span></span><a href="http://www.goosecreek.co.nz/"><span><span>Goose Creek</span></span></a><span><span> and is super local. They are based up at Huapai which is about 40 minutes drive from my place.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S3ZaQJ-usUI/AAAAAAAADXI/5epZj1Bh4MI/s400/IMG_3298.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also picked up some </span></span><a href="http://www.reallygood.co.nz/"><span><span>Really Good Peanut Butter</span></span></a><span><span>. How is it possible that peanut butters can taste so different from each other when their ingredients are just peanuts and sea salt? This particular one is incredibly strong and rich. Definitely not for the faint hearted!

<p>So by the time we got back from the market we were pretty starving so lunch was a quick salad with tomatoes and snow peas from the market and beetroot, carrot and lettuce from The Chef's garden. Some almonds from my fridge and a drizzle of the new olive oil and it was just perfect.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S3ZaKF-l8lI/AAAAAAAADW0/UPbNmH7_VEs/s400/IMG_3297.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We also had a 5-grain fruit and nut bread (also from the market and mine was smothered in the new peanut butter of course) on the side. I could have eaten half the loaf in one sitting it was so good. It didn't even need anything on it but peanut butter is addictive.

<p>I forgot to take a picture of dinner but here are some of the leftover Maori potatoes The Chef cooked up.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S3ZaNq-XzwI/AAAAAAAADXA/DZI9ZjTQ_4w/s400/IMG_3307.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Boiled, then fried with a dash of oil and some rosemary. I'm not normally a huge potato fan but these were really delicious. I'll have to go back and get some more!

<p>The Chef was working all day and into the night on Sunday so my lovely cousin D and I decided we'd have a girly Valentines Day together instead. After a quick blat round the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.bikepark.co.nz/"><span><span>bike park</span></span></a><span><span> (and spinning out on a root, landing in the wet sand) I picked her up and we headed off to lunch at </span></span><a href="http://www.librarycafe.co.nz/"><span><span>The Library</span></span></a><span><span>...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S3hoaQIpCDI/AAAAAAAADX8/eG9Qrx2gCLE/s400/IMG_3309.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...where I had pancakes again and ended up on a major sugar crash (seemed to skip the high and went straight to the crash unfortunately). Not a good idea...but they tasted good!

<p>Then we spent the afternoon curled up on my bed watching 2 girly movies in a row while devouring popcorn and chips (I think our eyes were about to pop out of our heads at this stage)! After all this we were hankering for some real food so I cooked us up some dinner.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S3hoZRgkD1I/AAAAAAAADX4/Sk-RX5ivq1w/s400/IMG_3312.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I sliced and fried up the leftover maori potatoes from the night before and served them with lemon tofu chunks, salad (where I practiced my oil-drizzling skills) and a ginormous corncob each (unpictured in case you hadn't worked that out). Very tasty. After this we were completely stuffed...but incredibly satisfied. Perfect!</span></span>
