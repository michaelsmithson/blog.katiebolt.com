            <h1><a href="../../../../rogaine_2_turkey_ridge/">Rogaine 2 - Turkey Ridge</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Turkey Ridge is one of the few farmland maps we have in the Auckland region and I think it's been a couple of years since I last ran there (I vaguely remember it was overcast and I stuffed up somewhere stupid but really that's not that uncommon!). It's steep...lots of contours, made worse by the fact the map uses 5 metre contours (that means that it's 5 metres in height between each contour line on the map...does that makes sense?).</p>

<p>Anyway, I was determined to plan my route better this time and be a bit more ambitious. Turns out I was probably still not ambitious enough but we'll get to that. When we got handed the maps it was raining so I went back to my car to plan my route so had no idea what other people were planning and just hoped I hadn't picked a stupid route. Obviously not as there was a huge train of us heading to #54 as their first control.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Rpv2OXi26sU7bi0BaOCSnCkT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-dEtAMbnlI/AAAAAAAADs0/OluqDVf802U/s400/Rogaine%202%20-%20Turkey%20Ridge.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
I got round most of the loop on the right-hand side of the track within 30 minutes so I realised then that I was going to have to head further out to the left than planned. As it turns out, I had a very similar route to another girl in my grade so we were sort of racing each other for most of the time. Every time I thought I was taking a different route she'd show up next to me a couple of controls later! It did help push me onwards a bit though.

<p>Once I got to #36 I gave myself a turnaround time (I think I had about 50 minutes to go at that point) but I didn't stick to it and turned around earlier than I needed to, mainly because the other girl and another guy who'd joined our little party were turning around at that point. I could have at least got #49 and maybe #56 and then dropped #41 later on which was so steep it wasn't really worth it. I ended up crossing past the finish with about 17 minutes to go. Picked up the last 3 I'd left for a finishing loop and was home with about 9 and a half minutes to spare and nowhere to use them up! GRRR! But I ended up with 1020 points which was pretty good really and got me 2nd equal in open women which was quite good.</p>

<p>Can't wait for next weekend though...Slater Road rocks and we have a mountain bike rogaine in the afternoon. Gonna be awesome.</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../rogaine_1_pulpit_rock/">Rogaine 1 - Pulpit Rock</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Sunday was the first of 4 foot events in the <a href="http://rogaineseries.co.nz/">North West Rogaine Series</a> and was held out on Pulpit Rock. As I explained in the <a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/2010/04/mtb-rogaine-1-riverhead.html">last post</a>, rogaines are different from regular orienteering events as you are given a time limit (in this series it's 90 minutes) and a map with all the controls on it and you have to try and get as many as you can in that amount of time. The controls are worth different amounts of points as well. All those from 30-39 are worth 30 points, 40-49 are 40 points and 50-59 are 50 points.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/BaIuDhY67yDerb9KlHePyykT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9SznBME_8I/AAAAAAAADow/1ah4iuhxnpY/s400/Rogaine%201%20-%20Pulpit%20Rock.jpg" alt="" title=""></a> <br>
<em>You can sort of see some of my working markings and eventual route if you click on the map. It's still not really big enough to get a good view though.</em></center> <br>
The added complexity of this map was that the top half of the map was using 5 metre contours (it's the steeper, more rugged area of the map) and the bottom section was using 2.5 metre contours. Transitioning between the 2 sections was quite a mind game.

<p>I planned out a rough route but ended up finishing that loop with half an hour to spare so headed up towards the top right of the map to grab some more points. It's pretty typical of me to underestimate how much I'll manage to do in the time given so the goal for the next event is to plan more ambitiously (but with shortcuts back if time isn't on my side).</p>

<p>I ended up getting 820 points which was okay but not great. From #39 to #43 to #56 I was pretty much walking 'cause it was so bloody steep and I was pretty tired by then so I'm not sure if it was such a great idea to leave that section to the end! Oh well...next time! But I did beat Owen and that's all that really matters!!! Oh, and my mate Rick and his friend came out to give it a go to and had a great time...I love converting people to the awesomeness of orienteering!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../mtb_rogaine_1_riverhead/">Mtb Rogaine 1 - Riverhead</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Saturday was the first of 2 mountain bike rogaines in the <a href="http://rogaineseries.co.nz/">North West Rogaine Series</a>. Although <a href="http://www.rogaining.com/">rogaines</a> are often confused with <a href="http://www.orienteering.org/i3/index.php?/iof2006">orienteering</a>, they are actually quite different (well, from my perspective anyway). Yes, the majority of people who compete in rogaines are orienteers of some sort because the skill-set is similar. But unlike an orienteering event where you must make your way around a set course in the fastest possible time, for a rogaine you are given a time limit (in this series it's 90 minutes but they can get up to 24 hours) and a map with all the controls on it and you have to try and get as many as you can in that amount of time. The controls are worth different amounts of points as well. All those from 30-39 are worth 30 points, 40-49 are 40 points and 50-59 are 50 points. The winner is the person with the most amount of points. If there is a tie then it is taken on the fastest time. There are also points deducted for every minute (or part minute) you are late (20 points in this series).</p>

<p>Anyway, this first event was a mountain bike rogaine held out at Riverhead which is notorious for being a mud bath because of its clay base. Apparently it's been brilliant and dry all summer and even last week it was supposed to be perfect riding conditions but, of course, in the days leading up to the event the rain came. And to make matters worse it was raining before the race too! Yep, it was gonna be muddy.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NnHezzbmfeenDq4Z2iK1GykT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9Szi9ZrWRI/AAAAAAAADos/LNGk_n9jE84/s400/MTBO%20Rogaine%201%20-%20Riverhead.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
I'd never done a rogaine on my mountain bike before and I'd also never ridden at Riverhead (I'd done a 3-hour foot rogaine last year when the weather had been so mad I was up to my chest in watery mud at one point) so I was pretty apprehensive. Rob wasn't very encouraging either when he came up and told me I was gonna hate it (I love his methods of encouragement)!

<p>Yeah, I wasn't too happy with my route choice in the end but I enjoyed it a lot more than I expected. I should have left more time for the controls in the bush nearer the event centre but I'd missed most of them out thinking that because they were single-track I would struggle in the mud. Turns out the couple I did manage to get to were beautiful. Damn it! There was a really frustrating part where I'd pushed the bike up this narrow single track through the gorse (should have gone round) and the clay had completely coated the bottom of my shoes so I had to attempt to scrape it out so I could clip back in once I started riding again.</p>

<p>It was quite a mission cleaning up the bike afterwards...took me a good hour of scrubbing 'cause mud was everywhere and by the time I'd got home it had started to dry off and clay does not want to be moved once it's dried. The shoes took another half an hour. Afterwards I realised I'd forgotten about my camelbak and mapboard which were also splattered in mud. Guess that's a task for tonight!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9S1J9EscXI/AAAAAAAADpI/oe7gsxXrCBg/s400/IMG_3510.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
And here's a closer look. No wonder clipping in and out got pretty hard by the end!
