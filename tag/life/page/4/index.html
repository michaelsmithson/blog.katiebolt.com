            <p></p><p>I'm still recovering from a long weekend of <a href="http://twalk.cutc.org.nz/">TWALK</a> adventures. TWALK is basically 24 hours of slightly mad fun running around in the hills trying to unravel cryptic clues (and then searching for the actual control) and getting your legs cut up by matagouri.</p>

<p>This was my 4th event (I missed out last year as I was in a cast and definitely not up to doing much) but M worked out it was his 15th TWALK! You can see more about my previous TWALKs <a href="../../../../since_i_ve_been_gone_/">here</a>, <a href="../../../../i_like_cookies/">here</a>, <a href="../../../../it_is_possible_to_eat_your_weight_in_food_/">here</a> and <a href="../../../../twalk_2010/">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">And the madness of TWALK begins...</p>

<p>This year the event started at <a href="http://www.topomap.co.nz/NZTopoMap/nz27978/Lake-Clearwater/Canterbury">Lake Clearwater</a> and the scenery was, as always, stunning. The guys all went in one team (dressed as duck hunters (The Rubber Ducky Hunters) complete with their own maimai which M rode home with on his bike somehow on Friday night) and us girls all went in another (as the Hen's Party - we left feathers everywhere as the first leg went on!).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-I6f3boOqzyA/U3shzTreY9I/AAAAAAAAFnU/dIEn6Gv9gZw/s640/twalk-1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">First leg fun amongst the matagouri.</p>

<p>This year's event was a little bit odd in that the first 3 legs seemed faster and easier than average so, very unusually, we made it through all 5 legs within the time limit although we didn't have much time for control searching by the 5th leg so it wasn't super successful. But, as usual, it was awesome (but more than a tiny bit brutal especially for those of us who were went out on all the stages). Basically it's the best event of the year!</p>

<p>I did intend to take some photos of the delicious lemon muffins I'd made to eat between legs but yeah, that didn't happen. But they certainly were good. I mean, I ate 5 of them during the race!</p>

<p>So next time I promise a food post.</p>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>This week marks my 3 year anniversary of moving to Christchurch and despite how crazy it has been it was definitely the best decision I could have made.</p>

<p>It's definitely been a 'different' experience though. I never thought I would be sent home from work or have the day off for earthquakes, snow and flooding (fortunately not all at the same time!) but there you go! This year has been the year of far too much rain resulting in pretty bad flooding across many parts of the city and, since we live by the river, it has been an interesting experience to say the least.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9ByC8YwzJ0g/U3BnFb8velI/AAAAAAAAFmU/4-ShPKenlJ4/s640/flooding.jpg" alt="">
</p><p style="text-align:center"><em>Somewhere under all that water is a road on either side of the river!</em></p>

<p>During the biggest flood, in March, we couldn't get out our driveway (well, we could if we'd really had to but it sure didn't look like fun). Fortunately we are high enough that the flooding doesn't affect our house but it's still pretty scary.</p>

<p>In more tasty news, I have just discovered a new vegan coconut yoghurt at my local supermarket. Doctors Choice Bio Yoghurt, a local Christchurch company, makes a <a href="http://www.bioyog.co.nz/dairy-free-coconut-yoghurt/">dairy-free coconut yoghurt</a> and it's really delicious!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uuhSTIc0wRo/U3BlVGrJswI/AAAAAAAAFl8/K8yGr2mW1VM/s400/yoghurt.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Seriously, if you see it I recommend trying it. Although I suspect it might only be stocked in the South Island at the moment.</p>

<p>Because it's late and I'm tired this will be pretty short but I guess what I should say is welcome to my new blog home!</p>

<p>For a super quick summary, since I last wrote:</p>

<ul>
<li>I went back to study</li>
<li>I finished study and started a new job</li>
<li>M and I bought a house!</li>
<li>I crashed my mountain bike and kinda smashed up my right wrist</li>
<li>Ummm, we've been on far too many adventures to even begin mentioning!</li>

<p>But the most exciting thing going on right now? M and I bought a tandem! After several months of borrowing a friend's (and trying not to destroy it or us) we finally ordered our own. Stay tuned for more tandeming adventures!</p>

Not exactly surprising considering it basically has an entire large block of chocolate in the icing! </p><p>After the usual wintery Wednesday Night run (basically a group of us meet up on a Wednesday night to go running in the Port Hills together) M and I tempted everyone back to where we were staying to help devour the cake.

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;">In the thick of that season there were few things more magical than ice - the blocks that emerged, impossibly, from the back of a wagon, steaming not with heat but with cold, the unmistakeable stomp of the iceman conquering the stairwell, gleaming blocks of ice piled on his broad back like enormous melting diamonds. <br>
- <em>Wickett's Remedy</em> by Myla Goldberg</span></p><p>So I appear to have been gone from here for quite some time. Oh dear! </p><p>Since I’ve gone so long I thought I would give you a little insight into some of the things that appear to have gotten in the way of blogging lately. Basically, life in the south has been filled with many adventures. </p><p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-zrX-aCiTNT4/UCiHg1ttnXI/AAAAAAAAFa0/5PEJo3u7UU8/s640/Running.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>There has been lots of running. I like running, especially in the hills. One day I will take the camera with me and show you all where I run every week. It's so beautiful here! And with more tracks slowly opening up again (after being closed for SO long because of earthquake/rockfall danger) there are more places you can safely go. <p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vmcREPHS8W0/UCiHSyWdVkI/AAAAAAAAFZ0/Wiy0K0iQIPc/s640/Biking.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>There has also been heaps of riding, especially since M bought himself a mountain bike and I upgraded. The best part about where we live is that you can go mountain biking straight from home without having to drive anywhere and there a lovely big hills to ride up and along on your road bike. I can't wait for summer and not needing to defrost after a ride though! <p>Anyway, below is just a little snapshot of some of my favourite adventures we've had so far (i.e. the ones where we have taken a camera!)... 
</p><center><strong>Oceania Mountain Bike Orienteering in Central Otago</strong><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-hJfrYE0QGZc/UCiHR9xqTNI/AAAAAAAAFZs/gGxdGsIQlTs/s640/Otago%2520MTB.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>Back at the start of the year, when it was warm and summery (which seems like a lifetime ago since now buried in winter and the weather outside today is particularly unpleasant) we had several days of mountain bike orienteering in Central Otago. It was fabulous (mostly) and I seem to have become addicted to mountain biking since returning home. <p></p><center><strong>Sprint the Bay 2012</strong><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DG4z-21lwJ0/UCiHWF6dU6I/AAAAAAAAFZ8/7DefayQmCyE/s640/sprint%2520the%2520bay.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>There has been plenty of orienteering happening this year to distract me and Sprint the Bay was one of the events we traveled to. Basically it is 3 days of sprint orienteering on various maps around the Hawke's Bay region. There was a nice big group of us from Southerly Storm up there to represent the South Island. <p></p><center><strong>Exploring the West Coast</strong><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-LkuL049NLDc/UCiHXQBSsOI/AAAAAAAAFaE/0F3w_2qBUHA/s640/West%2520Coast%252002.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>I'd never been to the West Coast of the South Island so M and I went to check out a bit of it. We stayed in the cutest little house right on the coast at Granity and explored a lot of the historic mining sites near by. The highlight was exploring <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denniston,_New_Zealand">Denniston</a> and getting to see the incline used to cart the coal down from the plateau. It has to be seen to be believed. It was also the first real test of my new bike. I think we're becoming very good friends! <p></p><center><strong>Orienteering Nationals 2012</strong><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-miZyfRfCI2Q/UCiHYtqm7hI/AAAAAAAAFaM/htl57aO8aSE/s640/nationals%25202012.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>Easter equals the National Orienteering Champs and this year it was up in Auckland so I got to have a little trip home at the same time. 4 days and 4 very different maps and getting to see people I hadn't seen in a long time made for a lot of fun (and lots of sand in our shoes and socks). <p></p><center><strong>Mountain biking at Craigieburn</strong><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-IvET2zI23zQ/UCiHaXkkamI/AAAAAAAAFaU/QF0_Ae-JwLA/s640/Craigieburn%2520MTB.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>We spent ANZAC Day with friends riding in the glorious sunshine at Craigieburn. Beech forest and incredible views made this a pretty cool day, even if the riding was rather scary in places. Hooning along the Hogs Back track down into Castle Hill at the end was an awesome way to finish a long day in the saddle.  <p></p><center><strong>TWALK</strong><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-BDbehMnncdY/UCiHbqoiwgI/AAAAAAAAFac/cMxKcqfmsFI/s640/TWALK_03.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>TWALK...<strong>THE</strong> event of the year. 24 hours of madness in the wilderness with a bunch of friends whilst wearing silly costumes cannot really be beaten. As an added bonus, our team won! <p></p><center><strong>Exploring the Mackenzie Country</strong><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-0KQ7A2gQGs4/UCiHe8BB6qI/AAAAAAAAFak/ICme6jKwUmM/s640/Tekapo%2520MTB%252002.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>What does one do when there is a long weekend? One goes on an adventure of course! For Queens Birthday we took our bikes for a few days of riding based out of Tekapo. Arriving in the late afternoon we had a beautiful ride along the Richmond Trail above Lake Tekapo as the sun was slowly setting. We got back to the car just before dark! Another day we rode up (and up and up) to the Omarama Saddle and pushed up the Saddle Ridge track even further where it was freezing and there was snow across the tops. We were far too cold to take pictures by that stage! <p></p><center><strong>Snow Day!</strong><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sXh2Te253E8/UCmGsTx0VRI/AAAAAAAAFbI/E-wQA30Mg18/s640/snow.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>Of course, what is winter without a snow day! I didn't believe snow was coming but that morning it was pouring with rain at our house so I dressed up in my wet weather gear and rode my old mountain bike to work. The closer I got the colder it got and the rain started to turn into ice and then snow flakes. By the time I reached work I was riding through snow drifts. It wasn't long before we were all sent home again! That night was the regular Wednesday night run in the hills and it was crazy because we didn't even need headlights as the snow seemed to light up the sky. <p></p><center><strong>Riding in Rotorua</strong><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-kB-vOQndSkw/UCiHfx7mRJI/AAAAAAAAFas/aT6JbOgPM_s/s640/Rotorua%252003.jpg" alt="" title=""></center>Last month we flew up to Rotorua for a few of days of riding in the <a href="http://redwoods.co.nz/mountainbiking.php">Whakarewarewa Forest</a>. The first couple of days we competed in a weekend of mountain bike orienteering events but we stayed extra days to explore the forest. It's like mountain bike heaven in there! Some of these adventures have not been so fun though. M and I have just recently returned to our flat after nearly 2 months living out of boxes at friends’ houses while EQC (the earthquake commission) “redecorated” it. That was not fun. Sigh. But now we are home and slowly unpacking again. I really should get a move on with that since I have some very exciting visitors arriving this weekend and it would be nice if the house looked somewhat, well, less like boxes and chaos. <p>There have also been lots of adventures in the kitchen but that is a story for next time... </p>
