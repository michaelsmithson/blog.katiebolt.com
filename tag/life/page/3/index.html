        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>It's a bit chaotic round here at the moment. So much to do before we leave to head overseas and I'm getting so nervous. Race notes and rules seem to be coming out thick and fast and it's all a bit overwhelming. Plus I've never been further than Australia before. I should be excited but I'm currently just a bit terrified!</p>

<p>Anyway, while I attempt to assemble some kind of order I will leave you with some of the more exciting food we've been eating this winter (in amongst the standard stir frys and all that jazz).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sL1y0hA0bLg/U9NyfKar2aI/AAAAAAAAFvo/3TU9sMX2MEM/s500/IMG_8598.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>One of my favourite dishes is the Lime Peanut Noodles with Seitan, Kale and Carrots recipe from <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Vegan-Yum-Yum-Lauren-Ulm/9780757313806">Vegan Yum Yum</a>. Well, I've never actually make it with seitan. Normally we just make it with a particular tofu that I get at the Funky Pumpkin (thinly sliced and fried) and we just use what ever vegetables we have on hand. Mushrooms, onion, capsicum, courgette, broccoli, spinach...all good things! It's even good cold or at room temperature inbetween <a href="../../../../the-24hr-hens-party/">TWALK legs</a>!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ib_Y7NIJZfw/U9Ny4twZLuI/AAAAAAAAFv0/bejV75L9Cyo/s500/macncheez.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Also awesome is the vegan mac and cheez from <a href="http://yeahthatveganshit.blogspot.co.nz/2007/10/creamiest-vegan-mac-n-cheez-ever.html">Yeah That "Vegan Shit</a>. I normally fry an onion and, if I'm feeling virtuous, some veggies to go in it too. And, because I'm lazy, it's really easy to just make in one pot rather than the 2 mentioned in the recipe. Seems to taste just as good to me! It's a great winter comfort food and delicious with salad.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qMF1DqtlJ3g/U9NziNUq6MI/AAAAAAAAFwA/TYTLpDCi-OQ/s500/corn-1.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Also good with salad is the <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/good-morning/simon-holst-s-recipes-pumpkin-cakes-corn-chip-casserole-2-june-2762424">Corn Chip Casserole</a> from Alison and Simon Holst's <a href="http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Very-Easy-Vegetarian-Alison-Holst-Simon-Holst/9781877246739">Very Easy Vegetarian</a>. It's not too hard to veganise. Just make up a white/cheezy sauce with soy milk and yeast flakes (well, obviously a few other ingredients like cornflour to thicken it, some olivani or other vegan margarine type thing and a nice little shake of smoked paprika is always a good thing) and you're good to go.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-awKCBhXJaLk/U9Ny468qkMI/AAAAAAAAFv4/Rf2hN9p9GMU/s500/pumpkin-soup.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But for real winter comfort food you really can't go past Pumpkin soup. All you need is a pumpkin (obviously), onion, some delicious spices (like a mild curry powder, cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika...), some vegetable stock (I just use water and stock powder - the <a href="http://www.rapunzel.de/uk/index.html">Rapunzel</a> vegetable bouillon is my favourite) and something to blend it up with (here's where a stick blender is awesome). Easy! Well, apart from cutting up the pumpkin which I delegate M to do! Super delicious served with hot scones (I veganise the Edmonds scone recipe - it's awesome every time). The above scones are even cheese ones as I bought the <a href="http://www.buteisland.com/a_cheddar_chives.htm">Sheese Cheddar Cheese and Chives</a> at <a href="http://www.pikowholefoods.co.nz/">Piko</a> I didn't end up liking all that much. It made excellent cheese scones though!</p>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>One of the things I love most about rogaines is the scenery. You get to go to places you would never normally be able to see (as the land is privately owned or you are well off the beaten track - busy thrashing through matagouri or climbing up through the tussock).</p>

<p>But there is always at least one moment where you wonder what on earth you are doing out there and you wish it could just end. Last weekend that moment came as we were clambering up the steep, rocky slopes of Mt Trotter. The tussock was so high I couldn’t see my team mate and was hiding the dreaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciphylla_colensoi">spaniard</a>, so I’d grab hold of some tussock to haul myself up with and find I’d managed to stab myself with the sharp points of the spaniard. It was worth it for the magnificent views and the 100 points we gained at the top though.</p>

<p>With no Heights of Winter last month I was definitely starting to feel anxious about not getting in a decent length race with my World Rogaine Champs teammate, L. We've done several short rogaines together (including a fun 3 hour one at Vic Park a couple of weekends back) and been in the same team for TWALK this year but a long rogaine is different. L is very fast and, as one of my friends says, an energizer bunny as well as being an excellent navigator. I was definitely getting anxious I wasn’t good enough to be her team mate.</p>

<p>Anyway, this past weekend we finally had a chance to race together at the Golden Road rogaine in Otago (in what was going to be a 13hr race but was cut down to 11 hours for various reasons).</p>

<p>A few of us drove down the night before and camped at the event centre (after a freezing weekend camping at Lindis Valley for a previous rogaine in April we all brought way too much gear for what turned out to be a fairly mild couple of nights!) so I picked up the map early and started planning our route...which turned out to be easier than normal - really just a matter of creating loops and working out which one to head out on first. So by the time L arrived I had a route all planned out (and fortunately she agreed with it!).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-67t7_4HPB6A/U8j7NElzUOI/AAAAAAAAFvM/vH1kiV9P03A/s640/golden-road-rogaine.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It was a pretty cold morning and we had a river crossing within a couple of minutes of starting (and then another one not long after that) so I think we were both glad to get to the first hill to start the warming up process. People were heading off all over the place and it only looked like a couple of other teams were heading out our way but they were a long way behind. This was pretty much the theme of the day as we hardly saw anyone out there and when we did they were going the opposite direction. It was like having the hills all to ourselves. Rogaines are funny like that. There could be hundreds of you out there but quite often you spend long periods of time seeing no one. Also, as usual, the scenery was spectacular. We didn't have a camera on us but there are some photos (and race reports) on <a href="http://tanecambridge.wordpress.com/2014/07/14/golden-road-rogaine/">Tane's blog</a> and <a href="http://runlongergeek.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/golden-road-rogaine/">Matt Bixley's blog</a> (complete with a photo of the awesome stone yards L and I got excited over).</p>

<p>We kept a pretty steady, quite fast (for me anyway, especially as I'd had a cold all week and was lacking that last bit of energy) pace, working as a team on our navigation. There was possibly a bit of a lack of focus (too much gossiping!) in the first hour but we got into a good flow. At just under 6 hours in we'd completed our first 2 loops so which meant we had time to head out the back to the far east of the map.</p>

<p>From #60 we ended up going to #42 first then #24 (the climb back up to this was tough going by this stage though) and in retrospect we should have left one of them out but we still thought we had time to finish with the #72 &gt; #48 &gt; #92 but by the time we actually got out to the road it was dark and we had 1 ¼ hours to go so it seemed too risky (if it had been daylight I think we'd have gone for it though) so we decided to abandon #72 and head straight to #48. We managed to screw up #48 and got ourselves into a panic (the first control in the dark is always entertaining!). Then it was an exhausting slog to the 90 pointer and down to #26 where we looked at our watches and saw we had about 15 minutes to go. We both joked that we'd get in trouble if we got back that early so we decided to risk another 10 points with #11. There was precious little time to get back to the finish after that so it was a mad dash down the hill to the woolshed where we got thwarted by all the stockyard gates! We must have clambered over at least 10 in our hurry! Made it with probably no seconds to spare!</p>

<p>All in all it was a great day and I am definitely feeling more confident about surviving the Worlds with L. We seemed to work well as a team and, most of the time, I didn't even feel too slow! Starting to get a little bit excited...2 ½ weeks until we leave!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../welcome-to-the-kitchen/">Welcome to the kitchen</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>When we were house hunting the kitchen was a big factor for me. In our previous flat it was in a separate room and consisted of one small bench and nothing else. It had awesome amounts of cupboard space but used to drive me crazy. Oh, and the fridge was in the laundry because the room was so awkwardly designed there was no real room for it in the kitchen. I like to cook and when people would come over they always tended to hover around in the kitchen rather than hang out in the lounge which seemed rather awkward.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-dvw1CQAon0Q/U75RDoxVqqI/AAAAAAAAFuI/QbXJ48cu_HM/s500/kitchen-1.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, our new kitchen is still small but only 2 or 3 years old and way more functional (and it has a dishwasher!!) plus the lounge, dining room and kitchen all open out into each other so not only is it more functional but it's also full of light (well, in summer when there's more daylight of course). I love it!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-rlD294Lth3s/U75TCplA_JI/AAAAAAAAFuU/4nGLZcaZCMA/s640/kitchen-2.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Of course, we are awaiting our EQC repairs so the kitchen will be getting a bit of a makeover (new paint - a brighter colour and, hopefully, a blackboard! We might get new lino as well but we'll see). But who knows when that will be. I'm not looking forward to it. We've already been through the EQC process as tenants and that was bad enough! At least our house only has minor damage. And, with the help (or perhaps despair?) of M's Mum who does interior design, M has let me choose some lovely bright yellow paint for the laundry (but maybe I can sneak it into some other places too...!).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-h7ydfVRmf6g/U75THK6fh5I/AAAAAAAAFuc/21CsiLLFM6k/s400/IMG_8821.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>So what's cooking on the stove there? Well, we had friends over on Saturday night for some trip planning and I made (steamed) Christmas Pudding but being all in the moment I didn't take a photo so instead you get a picture of the same pudding but from Christmas lunch (which we had at our place and hence I was in charge so it was all vegan which was pretty exciting). The flames were even more effective this time as it was dark and we turned off all the lights for the full effect. Some of our friends had never experienced the flaming pudding before so there was much excitement!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-VCuR3mO_sRQ/U75OvHN3yoI/AAAAAAAAFtw/qXr8DtERbZE/s500/xmas-pudding.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The recipe is a veganised version of the pudding my Mum has made for the last who knows how many years. I think she found it from a crock pot book. If anyone is interested in the recipe let me know and I'll put it up. It's delicious!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../winter-at-the-beach/">Winter at the beach</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Last weekend was supposed to be Heights of Winter, a 12 hour rogaine that happens every year in Canterbury around the full moon during June, but this year it was cancelled for, quite possibly, the first time after major flooding in North Canterbury earlier in the week. It's been a pretty wet year so far in Canterbury with with several floods in our street already and the hills are pretty green (they've been pretty brown for pretty much the whole time I've been here).</p>

<p>Anyway, we'd already booked a couple of baches in Gore Bay for the event so it seemed a shame not to head up there for the weekend anyway especially since the forecast was so spectacular.</p>

<p>Saturday a small group of us headed over to Kaikoura and up Mt Fyffe while the others did some other more epic icy mission. My favourite thing is going up steep hills so the track up to the hut was awesome (about 1100m). After that, however, the track started to get pretty icy and I ended up slipping over and hitting my head so M and I headed back down (and then up to the hutt again because hills are fun!) whilst the others continued. Spectacular views from the top and it wasn't even too cold!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tbRG92zPeH4/U6QCgYDKyUI/AAAAAAAAFp8/-Y8Q9lSbBWE/s640/mt-fyffe.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In the evening there was the most amazing full moon which I wished I'd taken a photo of. My friend C and I had a very lovely walk by moonlight along the beach. It was so beautiful and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore is like soothing music.</p>

<p>Sunday, after a lot sleep in (!), a group of us biked over the hills to the Hurunui River and back (with a few detours down to the coast). It was a perfect cycling day - not too cold and very calm.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Xbdbg6Rg2xA/U6QChSHtllI/AAAAAAAAFqE/3CyXm1fiCIs/s500/hurunui.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So all in all it was a pretty good weekend but still pretty sad there was no Heights of Winter this year especially since I could do with the training. We are heading to the States in about a month and a half for the World Rogaine Champs in South Dakota and I have yet to race a long rogaine with my team mate (other than TWALK and I'm not sure that really counts)! Hopefully the Golden Road Rogaine takes place next month. M has been helping me work on my route planning which is definitely helping.</p>

<p>But I better get ready for bed. Tomorrow is the shortest day here and we are planning on riding from sunrise to sunset (or something like that). Should be fun!</p>

            <p></p><p>Sometimes, if I'm lucky (and I'm lucky quite often!), M cooks dinner. Last week I was out running and he ate leftovers but then specially made me my own dinner (along with leftovers for lunch). I was so hungry there is no photo. But just imagine a delicious tofu stirfry on rice. Can't go wrong with that.</p>

<p>Another night he made an Indian curry with <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/product/chicken-style-strips/">Frys vegetarian chicken strips</a>. Delicious! Well, apart from being a bit too hot for me to handle!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-fDTTxTHKi3k/U5qHmrUtwAI/AAAAAAAAFo4/QvFRZshB61k/s400/chickenindian.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Then a couple of weeks back M also made pizza!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-L1NSOIOsisQ/U6AW1sV1KsI/AAAAAAAAFpo/L8jazZWGBxo/s400/IMG_8677.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>The dough was homemade (I love having a breadmaker!) and was topped with tomato paste, red onion, courgette, red capsicum, capers, tomato, tofu sausages and hummus. Hummus on pizza makes an excellent cheese substitute (it works best with plain hummus and don't be afraid to use heaps of it).</p>

<p>And last night he made me another tofu stirfry before we sat on the couch geeking out over rogaine maps.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-eIsRgZk0mik/U6AWLQCY0rI/AAAAAAAAFpQ/kHRGnkofQy8/s400/tofu.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">I love how it looks like a piece of carrot is trying to escape off the plate!</p>

<p>These are actually just a few of the meals M has cooked lately so basically I'm rather lucky!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../birthdays-for-queens/">Birthdays for queens</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>This past weekend was Queens Birthday weekend (her birthday is actually in April I think but I'm not complaining) so we got a lovely long weekend for some fun adventures. The weather was looking fantastic (but cold) pretty much everywhere which make trying to work out what to do much harder! In the end M and I settled for doing some long tandem rides from Murchison each day since we don't have the panniers set up for the new bike yet.</p>

<p>Saturday, after driving up from home, we set off up the road for a nice warmup ride towards Maruia Saddle. We rode as far as the main bridge before turning back since the sun was on it's way down and it was getting cold. It was the first time we'd taken the tandem out on the gravel and it seemed to handle it with ease.</p>

<p>Sunday morning we were crawling out of bed early ready for a long day. The plan was to ride to Westport (for hot chocolates and hot chips of course) and back which would be the longest day ride for both of us, coming in at over 200km. Exciting! </p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-e8EOJWz8Um0/U5Ar4jAfmtI/AAAAAAAAFog/6CGvTWQrHDI/s640/queen-01.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">Heading off to Westport following the mighty Buller River</p>

<p>It was a cold start but I'd warmed up by the time we got to the Upper Buller Gorge. The scenery was fantastic and there was very little traffic around so it made for pretty awesome riding conditions but M had promised me hot drinks in Inangahua which was about halfway to Westport. Unfortunately the only shop was closed (for sale I think) so we pressed on into the Lower Buller Gorge for more awesome scenery (and, finally, some sunshine!).</p>

<p>After a fairly painless 103km we'd made it to Westport and, after a quick trip out to the coast on the end of the pier (with a fantastic view back to the mountains and Denniston where we have ridden during a previous visit) it was off to the nearest cafe for hot chocolate and fries. Perfect! Not that we could stop long since we were conscious of the ever decreasing hours of daylight left!</p>

<p>The ride back was pretty good. We had a nice stop at the cafe in Berlins (it has a place name which makes it sound like a town but the only thing there is a cafe/accommodation) then it was back on the road. The sun vanished with about 20km to go and so too did any resemblance of warmth which made the end fairly torturous. I may have been wimpering a bit on the back!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-3ONL-6G26Vw/U5Ar41UZL-I/AAAAAAAAFok/IXNeKo8C4Dk/s640/queen-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">So much awesomeness. Clockwise from left: Westport! The Lower Buller Gorge. Beautifully calm at Lake Rotoroa</p>

<p>But if I'd thought it was cold then, well, Monday had another thing coming. We headed off along the back roads (via Braeburn Track) towards Lake Rotoroa and, despite being wrapped up in several warm layers and super thick lobster gloves, I felt like I was getting colder and colder. Once my feet started getting cold my right foot was really playing up making it difficult to pedal. The Braeburn Track goes up a valley through the bush that clearly gets no sun during the winter months as the frost was thick on the ground and the gravel was icy.</p>

<p>I did eventually manage to sort of warm up in time for a bouncy decsent down to Lake Rotorua where we had a delicious lunch of only slightly squashed sandwiches! The lake was beautiful and I would have liked to stay there longer but it was too cold so we had to bike on.</p>

<p>Despite the cold it was a fantastic weekend and a good test of our tandem on gravel roads (and long distances). M has ideas of us doing the 400km Marlborough Mayhem Kiwi Randonneurs ride in October which is a little scary and if Le Petit Brevet is happening again this year we were going to give that a go so we're going to have to put in some more long rides over the winter.
