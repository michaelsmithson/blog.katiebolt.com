...otherwise known as Saturday in Christchurch.</span></span></p>

<p>It started with coffee...or, more specifically, since I've never drunk a cup of coffee in my life, a ginger chai latte with rice milk from <a href="http://theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojwD03Z0I/AAAAAAAAEBQ/UKaE4bBN9pk/s400/IMG_3891.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I then wanted vegan pancakes and nobody was going to stop me...I doused them in maple syrup and they really didn't last long at all. I love pancakes (oh, and they can make them gluten free too if you so desire)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojuBF7HoI/AAAAAAAAEBM/BwTtr5cq4LE/s400/IMG_3892.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I've only just recently started climbing again after various injuries and events got in the way. Unfortunately winter is not really the best time for climbing outside so we just hit up The Roxx. Just so you know, I don't normally climb in socks (or polypro pants for that matter) but my feet were too cold.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoa6l4vgZI/AAAAAAAAD_M/a5DfpszMc2A/s400/IMG_3897.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There was an emergency peanut butter sandwich consumed partway through (well, not partway through a climb because that might be a little crazy).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojsdp-mnI/AAAAAAAAEBI/nXkPDe3Kfos/s400/IMG_3903.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yes, I have chalk all over my hands...they don't normally look that weird.

<p>Climbing makes me hungry so we went exploring for a stop of lunch/afternoon tea. And what did we find?</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobWITIeKI/AAAAAAAAEAc/lrRIbonAdtE/s400/IMG_3904.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yep, it's </span></span><a href="http://www.eternaldelight.net/"><span><span>Eternal Delight</span></span></a><span><span> - a raw vegan cafe. I didn't even know they existed (well, in New Zealand anyway). It was all terribly exciting but I had to remember we were going out for a fancy dinner so we couldn't eat too much so we decided to split a main and a dessert. B chose the Italian pizza and salad.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoa9NUBoXI/AAAAAAAAD_Q/fkRqNUYFu6s/s400/IMG_3913.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Seriously this was amazing. I don't know how they did it but just looking at the photo right now makes me want it again real bad. The salad especially was very impressive (yes, the pizza was great but there was something about that salad...).

<p>As a sweet treat I picked the Superfood Black Forest Cake which uses goji berries instead of cherries. The guy gave us a discount because it had fallen over. He said that normally it stands tall and proud. Again it was pretty awesome. We decided we'd have to come back here for their Friday night fine dining next time I'm down.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobUuYKM5I/AAAAAAAAEAY/243WuNBwbso/s400/IMG_3915.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And then we raced home to check <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/">trademe</a> (like eBay I guess but specifically for us here in New Zealand). You see, I had placed an auto bid on a road bike as the auction was going to close while we were out so I had no idea if I'd won or not. But guess what?! I won!!! This is exciting news number 1 (more to follow in the next post). I will probably post photos of it everywhere at some point. It's awesome!

<p>Anyway, moving on! Dinner was a special occasion made even more special because B and I were joined by my beautiful cousin D and her boyfriend. So basically, it was dinner with my bestest friends in the whole world and it really can't get much better than that. We decided to go to </p></span></span><a href="http://thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart </span></span></a><span><span>because it's fancy and they do awesome food.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobTayytKI/AAAAAAAAEAU/KW8dhSTr7jU/s400/IMG_3919.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Fries first...you can't really go wrong with that (plus their homemade tomato sauce is real good...they should bottle and sell it 'cause I'd definitely buy it). B ordered tea and I had to take a photo...I </span></span><strong><span><span>want</span></span></strong><span><span> this tea set.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobSLQrT_I/AAAAAAAAEAQ/XET_oevfYvE/s400/IMG_3920.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
D and I went with their homemade ginger beer...you also can't go wrong with that. I order it every single time.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobOE970BI/AAAAAAAAEAE/bWfyzbIYp0Y/s400/IMG_3921.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For our mains B and I decided to order a couple of different things and share (D and her boyfriend did the same). We got the vegan pizza which had their special cashew vegan aioli on it...I have to try this 'cause it tasted super cheesy (well, at least my memory of cheesy).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobQ1j-Y6I/AAAAAAAAEAM/YDgAtK9nqvQ/s400/IMG_3923.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We also ordered the curry of the day. Somehow I have managed to delete the photo I took of this...oops! Anyway, I can't remember now what it was but it was tasty which is really all that counts. I think the waiter was quite impressed that we polished off all this food with such ease (and then casually asked for the dessert menu too).

<p>Dessert...raw pumpkin pie with raw ice cream. Oh my god! This was really REALLY good. So good that I was very surprised. It was also a ridiculously large portion and I couldn't even finish it which is quite a rare thing for me. I had to take the leftovers home (there was no way I was letting it go to waste!).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobPdiXeGI/AAAAAAAAEAI/LVbk9z1QBRg/s400/IMG_3927.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And to finish off an awesome night? We went to live comedy...a perfect night (especially because B and I tried to book too late so they'd sold out but somehow 2 people cancelled right before the show was about to start so we got their tickets).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojzRuUMZI/AAAAAAAAEBY/M77Bi71QLuc/s400/IMG_3933.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

<p>My new flat is on the edge of an orienteering map...how cool is that?! Admittedly it's just a park map but still, it's pretty awesome. I mean, I've lived down the road from maps but never, well, actually on a map before. I've run past this house countless times. I know this area backwards. You just don't understand how cool this is!</p>

<p>Okay, rant over! Moving on...</p>

<p></p><div><span><span>A couple of weeks ago my beautiful cousin K and my awesome brother C came round for one final dinner at my old flat. I was trying to clean out my fridge and pantry so I cooked up all the potatoes I could find, a block of tofu and every vegetable I had left (apart from all the carrots because if I'd done that we would have turned orange). Oh, and finished off the last of a jar of peanut butter and one of macadamia nut butter.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TDKkhCsSDbI/AAAAAAAAD4c/-SURLCsCJyg/s400/IMG_3730.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here's my plate.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TDKkjT7G74I/AAAAAAAAD4k/LsjyyEiZyN4/s400/IMG_3731.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dessert was also made (a team effort) but unfortunately I forgot to take a photo! I made the Lower Fat Banana Bread from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/nomicon.html"><span><span>Veganomicon</span></span></a><span><span> but since I didn't have any apple sauce I actually just added an extra banana and it seemed fine...until I overcooked it in the oven (I think I had it turned up a bit high). It was still good hot and slathered in olivani.

<p>Also recently was my Dad's birthday which, naturally, called for cake. But before we can get to cake you've got to eat dinner like a good girl right?</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TDKkqE-GxdI/AAAAAAAAD4w/pXEl_8uIiR0/s400/IMG_3723.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Mum made the vegetarian shepherds pie from Alison and Simon Holst's Meals Without Meat but adapted a dumpling recipe to put on top instead of the usual potato mash mixture. It's good. I should get the recipe.

<p>Anyway, how about cake...?</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TDKkfEO9ymI/AAAAAAAAD4Y/zrKxuiC-PBA/s400/IMG_3726.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was, unsurprisingly, in charge of cake and spent ages trying to decide what to make. I ended up going for the Peanut Butter Banana Cake from </span></span><a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/recipes/cookbook/"><span><span>The 100 Best Vegan Baking Recipes</span></span></a><span><span>. It is basically a banana cake with peanut butter cream cheese icing...and is really tasty!!! I can't believe I hadn't made it until now considering how many of Kris's other cakes I've made.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TDKkdSfsB1I/AAAAAAAAD4U/zxGgMUkVPn4/s400/IMG_3728.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

<span><span> <br>
My Aunty turned 60 recently so that called for a bit of a celebration. As usual, I was left in charge of making the cake. For my Dad's 60th I made him a rocket ship cake. For my Mum's 60th I made a gingerbread house (with a chocolate roof) complete with a garden. Yes, the old </span></span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=2356371047"><span><span>Australian Women's Weekly Children's Birthday Cake</span></span></a><span><span> book gets a lot of use around here. My Aunty was flipping through it and got her heart set on the train cake so that became my mission...</span></span></p>

<p>But first I had to veganise her favourite lentil roast (she was making a normal roast and wanted her usual lentil roast to go with it). Personally, I thought it was kind of boring and I'd make a whole heap of adjustments before making again but I've posted the recipe at the bottom of this post in case anyone's interested.</p>

<p>I ended up running out of time to make the gravy 'cause decorating the cake was taking much longer than I'd anticipated (although I did sleep in which didn't help) so I had to make an emergency call to Mum to help out (a tahini gravy from this old wholefoods cookbook that we both have). Lucky we have some of the same cookbooks so I could just tell her the name of the book and the page number. Yay!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TBVchNQdQyI/AAAAAAAAD20/bGd9U4u9yTk/s400/IMG_3676.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
So here's my dinner plate - lentil roast with tahini gravy, salad, stir-fry veggies and roast potato, kumara and pumpkin (I didn't end up eating the potato in the end though...I just can't love potatoes, at least not like how I love kumara).

<p>I then proceeded to get a bit tipsy on wine (I was given this bottle as payment for raking mountain bike tracks at my mate's farm). I'll be honest and admit it only takes 1 glass and I'm a bit lost.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TBVciEu7aNI/AAAAAAAAD24/2qvnngO-zn8/s400/IMG_3680.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My cousin D was in charge of the evening and her belief is that dessert is the main meal of any celebration so there was lots of it. My dessert bowl consisted of apple crumble and trifle (after a bit of instruction, Mum was able to whip up my famous trifle...feels a bit weird knowing she made it and not me but it was still awesome).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TBVclt2DRzI/AAAAAAAAD3A/YkkSxmbeUTo/s400/IMG_3692.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'd lent Mum my copy of </span></span><a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/recipes/cookbook/"><span><span>The Damn Tasty Vegan Baking Guide</span></span></a><span><span> but luckily there are my favourite cake recipes in </span></span><a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/"><span><span>Kris</span></span></a><span><span>' other book, </span></span><a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/recipes/cookbook/"><span><span>The 100 Best Vegan Baking Recipes</span></span></a><span><span>. I made 2 different kinds - carrot cake and chocolate cake (using the Black Forest cake recipe) with the front being all chocolate and the 2 carriages being mostly carrot cake with a thin layer of chocolate along the tops (to make the carriages higher). Luckily it all worked out because I started baking without any idea on how I was going to put it together...note for next time: plan otherwise you'll email your cousin and call your Dad several times out of panic.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TBVcfjvLLyI/AAAAAAAAD2w/agWVJVHDROQ/s400/IMG_3684.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span>

Here's my slice of cake. People were very reluctant to destroy the cake which was both flattering and annoying. Come on people, it's made for eating...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TBVcmun-G_I/AAAAAAAAD3E/D3xpS_WuP0Y/s400/IMG_3708.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And then to top off the evening I decided to play their piano...bad idea for a girl who recently cracked a bone in one of her fingers. I am a hopeless case!

<p>Anyway, here's the recipe for the lentil roast if anyone is interested. I have no idea where the original recipe came from...</p>

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span>Lentil Roast</span></span></strong><span><span>

<p>1 cup red lentils <br>
2 cups water <br>
1 onion, finely chopped <br>
25g vegan margarine <br>
1 tsp mixed herbs <br>
grated vegan cheese (as much or as little as you want (or can afford because let's be honest, vegan cheese is expensive!) <br>
1 Tablespoon lemon juice <br>
1 flax egg (I used 1 Tbsp ground flaxseed whipped with 3 Tbsp water) <br>
salt <br>
pepper <br>
paprika <br>
4 weetbix, crushed <br>
wholemeal flour to coat <br>
little oil for cooking</p>

<p>Put the lentils and water in a saucepan and simmer gently, uncovered, until the lentils are tender and all the liquid is absorbed (which is apparently about 20 minutes but I can't remember how long it took me).</p>

<p>Set the oven to 190C.</p>

<p>Fry the onion in margarine (or oil if you want but I felt in the mood for margarine) for 10 minutes until soft and lightly browned then add this to the lentils together with the mixed herbs, cheese, lemon juice, flax egg, salf, pepper and paprika.</p>

<p>Add a few crumbled weetbix (I used 4 from memory) to stiffen the mixture.</p>

<p>Oil the loaf tin and coat it lightly with flour and then spoon the mixture into the tin. Lightly brush the top of the loaf with a bit of oil and bake 45 minutess until brown and crisp, basting the top with oil from time to time.</p>

<p>Tip out of the tin and slice, served with tahini gravy or similar.</p></span></span>

So, it didn't flood while I was in Queenstown. In fact the weather was pretty amazing (well, it was freezing but it is basically winter so you can't have everything). The lake levels were definitely up (some of the trees on the lake edge were under water) and buildings on the waterfront were barricaded with sandbags but the rain had stopped by the time I arrived. Below is the view from the deck of the apartment (I got a similar view from my bedroom on the floor below). We were working up here too so when things got too stressful I snuck a peak out the window and it was quite refreshing.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9_L2LKi3kI/AAAAAAAADrU/Ty2iyjmRcl8/s400/IMG_3533.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
As far as food went, we ate out every dinner but I was mostly out with my boss so I wasn't in picture-taking mode (he thinks I'm weird enough as it is I think!). But I did get one night to myself...no trip to Queenstown is complete without a visit to </span></span><a href="http://www.fergburger.com/"><span><span>FergBurger</span></span></a><span><span>. This is the Holier Than Thou burger which is tempured tofu with a spicy satay, coconut, coriander sauce, lettuce, tomato, red onion and alfalfa (it also comes with aioli but I got them to ditch that).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9_LpSLHzuI/AAAAAAAADrA/HA2o5uH-FLg/s400/IMG_3539.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yes, the burger is massive...that is a dinner plate it is sitting on. I'm not sure what possessed me to order chips since they give you enough to feed a small army (I ate quite a bit more than what is pictured and still hadn't made it through half). This time I couldn't even finish all the burger. I got about three quarters of the way through before giving up and just eating the filling. I was so full I could barely move (I swear I cannot eat the amount that I could not that long ago...it's weird).

<p>Anyway, to avoid this post being devoid of much food (and just generally lacking!), I will present you with food I've eaten since getting back from Queenstown!</p>

<p>My mate B was up from Christchurch for the weekend so I dragged him over for dinner on Saturday along with The Chef. While I made satay tofu...my way (there was a debate about this at the supermarket), the boys prepared dessert. Anyway, my satay tofu on brown rice is quite possibly one of my favourite meals ever and definitely my favourite pre-race meal (I had a race on Sunday morning) so I made a huge batch which gave me leftovers to have cold for lunch the next day.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-h3mMyIGwI/AAAAAAAADtA/pWS2Jk-h1TA/s400/IMG_3591.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dessert was gluten-free crumble as The Chef was on the last couple of days of his diet thingy. While B peeled the 5 apples (there was a funny debate about whether to have 4 or 5 apples at the supermarket too!), The Chef whipped up an awesome topping. I think it was made from buckwheat flour, chopped almonds, coconut, brown sugar, cinnamon and oliviani...but I can't really remember). Once the apples were all chopped, they added frozen blueberries and a truck-load of sugar (no wonder crumbles taste so sweat and delicious in restaurants!) and chucked it in the oven while we ate dinner.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-h3oL2lCkI/AAAAAAAADtE/zZNcutYPZOg/s400/IMG_3593.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
SO good!

<p>Sunday was Mother's Day so after a day of orienteering (my parents both compete too sometimes) and a quick blat round the mountain bike park my brother and I trouped off to my parents' house for dinner. Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie and salad...awesome winter comfort food.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-dozDsRh1I/AAAAAAAADs4/TqNbsDkU7SE/s400/Mothers%20day%202%20CS2.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was going to make a fancy dessert (I really want to try and make sweet potato (kumara) pie with maple syrup) but time was never going to be on my side so instead I made crumble...yep, crumble 2 nights in a row!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-do0E9NeAI/AAAAAAAADs8/M-dA55EfI9g/s400/Mothers%20day%203%20CS2.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Apple and berry crumble with a crumble topping made with rolled oats, wholemeal flour, chopped almonds, coconut, dark brown sugar, cinnamon, and olivani. So good! And Mum sent me home with leftovers which I ended up eating for breakfast the next day (she also sent me home with homemade bread she had in the freezer so I didn't have to worry about lunch)!

<p>Ah, mothers, what would we do without them?! ☺</p></span></span>

- </span></span><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Dead Until Dark</span></span></em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span> by Charlaine Harris</span></span>
<span><span> <br>
It was my cousin K's birthday on Sunday so of course this needed celebrating. Ironically she wasn't able to make it last minute 'cause she was sick but we thought we'd celebrate anyway 'cause everything was all ready to go.</span></span></p>

<p>We were greeted with a cool appetiser tray my Aunty had made which was a relief 'cause by the time I'd picked everyone up and driven across to the shore I was starving. Oh, and there were also plain pringles in the mix but they didn't make it onto the tray. I could have quite happily polished this whole thing off by myself but managed to restrain so there was still room for dinner.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S8JFfLbyqdI/AAAAAAAADk4/tKSjsdHoW8w/s400/IMG_3482.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For the main course my super sweet Aunty cooked The Chef and I up some plain rice and her famous maple syrup tofu which we had with the stir-fry veggies my Uncle cooked. The tofu was so good and I've got to get the recipe off her so I can recreate it.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S8JFeCssEjI/AAAAAAAADk0/LhPYbhR2N-U/s400/IMG_3485.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We went back for seconds (and I vaguely seem to remember The Chef going back for thirds even!).

<p>As usual I was in charge of the cake. I doubled the recipe for the Cookies and Cream Pound Cake from </p></span></span><a href="http://www.mysweetvegan.com/about-the-book.php"><span><span>My Sweet Vegan</span></span></a><span><span> and baked it in a regular round cake tin instead of the loaf tin the recipe called for. I also cut down on the sugar 'cause 20 crushed cookies plus sweetened soy yogurt (the only unsweetened one here is not a good consistency for baking) plus 1 1/2 cups sugar seemed just a tad excessive (not sure how much I ended up using but it was less than a cup and I couldn't find any white sugar in my pantry so used soft brown sugar instead).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S8JFrIc_1XI/AAAAAAAADk8/V9QLstYUyQU/s400/IMG_3490.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Surprisingly this wasn't nearly as rich or as sweet as I expected and was actually pretty nice although I reckon it would be better warmed with soy ice cream or something like that. If you didn't like oreos though, well I don't think you'd like this cake (but I'm not a huge fan and still enjoyed it but carrot or chocolate cake would be my preferences)!

<p>I don't think I'd make this cake again but I do like trying out different things and it certainly was something a bit different and interesting. Can't wait for the next birthday to create something new!</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
My lovely cousin D decided she wanted to compete in a running race and chose the 6km </span></span><a href="http://www.totalsport.co.nz/events/coastal/index.php"><span><span>North Shore Coastal Classic</span></span></a><span><span> as her first attempt and I accompanied her round the course. She did an amazing job, running almost the whole way while I talked my head off and probably drove everyone else around us a little crazy! It was a nice gentle cruise for me which was a good recovery after the day before and the weather was glorious so all in all it was a good day.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S4sggHCHFBI/AAAAAAAADeM/F7-oGUtiO9I/s400/IMG_3344.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, after the race I whipped us up some food from her Christmas present to me, <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9781600940002/Anis-Raw-Food-Kitchen">Ani's Raw Food Kitchen</a> (admittedly we only just exchanged gifts last week 'cause we're a bit behind the times!). First up was a scramble using the Love the Chicks Pate as the base with diced tomato, capsicum, avocado and baby spinach.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S4sgMQ-dUGI/AAAAAAAADeI/EIdRCWyDuHo/s400/IMG_3349.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was the recipe that caught my eye when I first picked this book up ages ago on a typical browse in Borders and I knew it was the first thing I wanted to make when I got the book. It was super easy to make (chuck everything in the food processor and off you go then stir in your veggies...easy as pie) and tasted really good but it was very rich especially after all that time out in the sun and we didn't end up eating that much.

<p>The second course was the Coconut Breakfast Cakes with maple syrup and melon. I ended up using LSA instead of ground flaxseed and mixed in chopped walnuts and blueberries too.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S4sgK0tnwUI/AAAAAAAADeE/FHWw0UvaBJ8/s400/IMG_3353.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Now these were delicious which totally surprised me 'cause when I first read the ingredients I couldn't understand how they could taste good. The LSA I used (and the flaxseed I buy) is obviously a much darker colour to what she used 'cause mine came out a lot darker than the picture but oh well! I will definitely make these again and mix up the ingredients and additions even more.

<p>On Sunday night The Chef and I hit up the Lantern Festival at Albert Park in the city (along with his family and the entire population of Auckland it seemed!). I wish I'd taken my camera 'cause we got some awesome (and crazy) food and there were some beautiful lights. Veg "chicken" nuggets, veg "corn dogs" (ewww!), BBQ corn, banana leaf rice with bean curd, vietnamese spring rolls (also not that crash hot unfortunately) and freshly squeezed orange juice. There was so much more to try too but my stomach was too full by then!</p>

<p>Anyway, it's the year of the tiger and tigers are my favourite animal so that rocks (and the tiger lantern was beautiful - you can see a closeup of its face </p></span></span><a href="http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/events/lantern/Default.asp"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>)!</span></span>
