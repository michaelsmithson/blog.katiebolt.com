Things have been busy and now things are just plain </span></span><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake?label=Christchurch+quake"><span><span>overwhelming and scary</span></span></a><span><span>. It all seems so surreal. Everyone I know in Christchurch is okay but that doesn't really make it that much better. I can't help worrying about M and all my friends. I just want them here and safe. Makes being at work seem completely irrelevant.</span></span></p>

<p>But you've got to try and keep your spirits up so here is the cake I made for a combined birthday party we had in Christchurch a few weeks ago for M and our friends.</p>

We ran around outside doing a crazy orienteering course, we ate lots of delicious food and even more delicious cake and we danced to awesome 80s music until I was too tired to stand up any more. Beautiful memories.</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Deep groans and creaks shivered her bones, as though some vast ship a thousand times bigger than any human vessel was sailing past their window, mere inches away but invisible behind the thick, cold mist. <br>

Yes I know, it's not Christmas any more. It's not even 2010 any more! But anyway, I thought I would share my tofukey recipe that I subjected everyone to at our family Christmas party.</span></span></p>

<p>I remember reading about tofukeys and finding the whole idea hilerious so a few years ago I thought I'd look up a recipe and see if I could create my own one for our family Christmas party. It ended up going down really well and tasting delicious so I made it again the following year. Last year I made something else but this year it was back and better than ever.</p>

<p>Below is the recipe for the tofu part. For the stuffing I used the Seasonal Stuffing with Nuts recipe from <a href="http://www.vegantable.com/index.html"><span><span>The Vegan Table</span></span></a><span><span>. I halved the recipe and still ended up with way too much but that's okay 'cause you just end up with delicious leftovers! I did add a little more liquid than the original recipe though so that it held together better...but feel free to use your own stuffing. The recipe sounds complicated but actually wasn't nearly as hard as I expected.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQ6OzMgZYqI/AAAAAAAAEs4/QD6yabyIWu0/s400/IMG_0462.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
</span></span><strong><span><span>Tofukey</span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>Tofukey</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
350g firm tofu, drained <br>
1 1/2 Tbsp cornflour <br>
2 Tbsp nutritional yeast <br>
2 tsp powdered vegetable stock powder <br>
2 garlic cloves, crushed <br>
1/4 cup roasted, unsalted peanuts <br>
1/4 cup roasted, unsalted cashews <br>
1/4 cup chopped, fresh herbs (sage, thyme, parsley, marjoram) <br>
freshly ground pepper

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Stuffing</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Your choice...I used the Seasonal Stuffing with Nuts from </span></span><a href="http://www.vegantable.com/"><span><span>The Vegan Table</span></span></a><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Marinade</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
1/4 cup olive oil <br>
2 Tbsp soy sauce <br>
1 Tbsp tahini <br>
2 Tbsp orange juice <br>
1 teaspoon French mustard

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Tofukey</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
In a food processor, puree all ingredients. Place in a bowl in the fridge while preparing the stuffing.

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Stuffing</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Once you've made the stuffing you may need to add more liquid so that you can roll or press it into a log about 20cm long. I tend to wrap mine in baking paper and squeeze it to make it stay together!!

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Marinade</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Whisk all the ingredients together.  Set aside.

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Assembly and Cooking</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Preheat the oven to 175°C.

<p>On the kitchen bench lay down 2 pieces of baking paper.  On top of the baking paper spread the tofu mixture in a thin rectangle about 24cm long and wide enough to wrap around the stuffing log.  Place the stuffing log on the centre of this.  Carefully lift the edges of one end of the paper, lifting the tofu up and over the stuffing.  Gently pull the paper away from the tofu and lay flat again leaving the tofu around the stuffing.  Repeat with the other side.  The tofu mixture should meet at the top and wrap all the way around the stuffing.  Gently press the edges of the tofu mixture together and smooth over.  Press the tofu over the ends of the stuffing log and smooth this over also.</p>

<p>Brush the entire top of the roast with about half of the marinade (keep the other half for basting later).</p>

<p>Wrap up the roast with the baking paper and then wrap in a couple of layers of foil.  Gently place in a baking tray and bake for about 45-60 minutes.  Remove from the oven, allow to cool, and then refrigerate until about 1 hour before serving.</p>

<p>About an hour before serving, gently unwrap the roasts.  Brush with more marinade (make sure there is still some reserved after this) and re-wrap.  Place in the oven and bake for about 20-30 minutes at 175°C</p>

<p>Remove foil and baking paper.  Brush with the remaining marinade and place back into the oven for around 20 minutes or until golden brown.</p>

<p>Slice and serve with cashew or tahini gravy.</p>

I have a thing for peppermint chocolate so it wasn't surprising that </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/11/am-i-ever-home.html"><span><span>I fell instantly in love with Revel's mint slice</span></span></a><span><span>. So what better way to spend Christmas Eve than trying to concoct my own version!!

</span></span><strong><span><span>Mint Slice</span></span></strong><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Base</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
125g margarine, room temperature <br>
1 cup brown sugar <br>
1 cup flour <br>
1 tsp baking powder <br>
1/4 cup cocoa <br>
1 cup coconut thread

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Mint Filling</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
3 Tbsp margarine, room temperature <br>
3 cups icing sugar, sifted <br>
1/4-1/2 tsp peppermint essence <br>
1-2 Tbsp milk (oat, soy, rice etc)

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Chocolate topping</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
250g (1 block) Whittaker's Ghana Peppermint Chocolate (or any block of chocolate really but I only had this one on hand...) <br>
1 Tbsp margarine

<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line a 20 x 20cm square baking tin with baking paper.</p>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Base</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Cream together the margarine and brown sugar until fluffy. Beat in the rest of the ingredients until just combined and then press into the prepared baking tin. Bake for about 15-20 minutes. Let cool.

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Mint Filling</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Beat the margarine until light and fluffy and then slowly add the icing sugar whilst beating. Add the peppermint essence and milk until you reach your desired consistency. Spread the filling over the top of the cooled base.

<p>Melt the chocolate and the margarine together and then spread gently over the mint filling. Chill until firm enough to cut into slices (about 20 pieces...).</p>

<p>Eat.</p></span></span>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Time, unfortunately, though it makes animals and vegetables bloom and fade with amazing punctuality, has no such simple effect upon the mind of man. The mind of man, moreover, works with equal strangeness upon the body of time. An hour, once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length; on the other hand, an hour may be accurately represented on the timepiece of the mind by one second. <br>

<span><span> <br>
It was D's birthday recently and birthdays are important and need to be celebrated. Don't think about it as getting older (we're only as old as we feel anyway). Think about it as celebrating another year of being alive. Being alive is really quite underrated and trust me, it is definitely something worth celebrating.</span></span></p>

<p>We were going to have a little party a couple of days later but on the actual day I took her out for dinner at <a href="http://www.revive.co.nz/"><span><span>Revive</span></span></a><span><span>. No one should spend their birthday alone.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THG57sFFwFI/AAAAAAAAEJI/I-qnaB9diG0/s400/IMG_4078.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is their hotpot of the day, the Tangy Tandoori Chickpeas which was served on brown rice and I chose the Juicy Bangkok Slaw for my salad. I love their slaws and this was a pretty good hotpot. I was starving so it really hit the spot.

<p>Then a couple of days later we had a little party at D's parents. Aunty L loves creating platters...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THG59IIH2yI/AAAAAAAAEJM/gp-3U9L7WGI/s400/IMG_4080.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The dip was a spicy red bean dip from one of Alison and Simon Holst's Meals Without Meat books. I could have probably eaten the entire contents (this may have partly been because I was really rather hungry by then). I restrained myself but it was very good.

<p>Everyone else was eating my Aunty's seafood chowder but she had whipped me up some kind of veggie and lentil casserole and it was pretty good. I ate it with more corn chips and the remaining veggies from the platter.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THR8KcDlkZI/AAAAAAAAEKA/M7s07ao_yI0/s400/IMG_4098.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And then we had cake...which is really the main event when it comes to birthday food. I seem to have found my place within our family as the birthday cake maker. I'm not complaining (for a start, if I make it then I know I can eat it and I like cake so getting to eat it is a real bonus!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THG5-e7SceI/AAAAAAAAEJQ/dPwI2uZ3XrQ/s400/IMG_4088.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We are quite good at polishing off a cake in our family. Life is far too short for tiny slivers.

Sing the title as a round...it's great fun (then try singing happy birthday followed by 'For she's a jolly good fellow' also as a round...that's even more fun although we may have drunk a fair amount of wine by then)!</span></span></p>

<p>A little celebration was called for, despite the fact it was a couple of weeks late so my kiwi brother (as opposed to my American brother), my lovely cousin D and I trouped off to my parents place for delicious food and good times.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGdzQmBAXzI/AAAAAAAAEGU/gSFRYP1lBxg/s400/IMG_4020.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dinner was tofu stir-fry and oven chips (kumara chips for me but there were potato chips too). Mum seasoned them with kelp salt which was super delicious, and I convinced her to leave the skins on...I've now made my parents converts. Awesome.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGdzRvXdfRI/AAAAAAAAEGY/pQXQWf_5u-w/s400/IMG_4032.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I've been dying to try a raw dessert for ages so this seemed like the perfect opportunity. I ended up deciding on The Real Cheezecake from Ani Phyo's book </span></span><a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9781600940002/Anis-Raw-Food-Kitchen"><span><span>Ani's Raw Food Kitchen</span></span></a><span><span>. Very costly to make so I'd been saving it for a special occasion but it is super easy.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGdzN_3rkHI/AAAAAAAAEGM/32Ad5yaUg8M/s400/IMG_4075.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It was sensational (better than I expected to be honest)...very filling but not too rich and everyone loved it which was cool. I thought they might think it was a little too weird or something but no, it was welcomed into everyone's stomaches with open mouths.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGdzPbfcxqI/AAAAAAAAEGQ/1Ipv8K8H0N8/s400/IMG_4014.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
<span>Wine and apple cider...they do say don't mix your drinks and they may be right! Also not so good when you have a race the next day but I couldn't stop laughing most of the night so that can't be a bad thing right?</span></span></span><span><span>

<p>Oh, and just in case anyone else was interested...Beauty and the Beast in 3D was awesome. I may or may not have needed tissues.</p></span></span>

<p>We ate porridge, went orienteering (otherwise known as running round in circles and standing round in the freezing cold afterwards), sat in front of the fire and ate peanut butter sandwiches. Oh, and I got asked to do the <a href="http://wrc2010.org.nz/"><span><span>World Rogaine Champs</span></span></a><span><span>. ARGH!!!! Exciting!!!!!!

Personally this could almost be exciting news number 3 but you might laugh at me. Beauty and the Beast is, like, my favourite movie of all time (okay, maybe a close second after <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The Princess Bride</a>). And now it's in 3D!

<p>Anyway, once I'd calmed down from that excitement,  we popped over to visit D at her motel to eat cake...certain celebrations always need cake right?</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokE8pVrvI/AAAAAAAAECE/Nxk_FTLRtvM/s400/IMG_3941.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I like cake (although making them in B's kitchen is not quite so good since it is lacking in some vital equipment so it's lucky I brought my cake pan down with me)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj1uuARGI/AAAAAAAAEBc/i4L5HGB5w4c/s400/IMG_3947.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then for dinner we went to the </span></span><a href="http://www.thedux.co.nz/christchurch/home"><span><span>Dux de Lux</span></span></a><span><span> which is a vegetarian and seafood pub (I think they used to be solely vegetarian but they now serve seafood as well). With heaps of the meals you get a salad on the side (which you get to pick). There were 2 vegan options this time so I went with both...a tofu and vege one and a green salad. The tofu salad was divine.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj2wosQiI/AAAAAAAAEBg/ZREty916MfQ/s400/IMG_3949.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also really like their (alcoholic) ginger beer. You may have noticed I like ginger and since discovering that alcohol, in moderation, is really not that scary, this is a very nice drink.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokGq41U7I/AAAAAAAAECM/JPj91DRABpk/s400/IMG_3951.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We wanted kumara chips but it was not to be (they were sold out) so we settled with buffalo wedges. This plate destroyed us and we left way too many on the plate for my liking but my stomach was just not gonna take any more.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokJpzlI0I/AAAAAAAAECU/BgwyUqqd4AM/s400/IMG_3958.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For my main I ordered the corn and vegetable fritters which are served with a beetroot chutney. I had these last time I was here but I didn't feel like the Indian dish and I can get a red tofu curry up in Auckland any day. Plus I like corn fritters. They were better than I remembered too.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokIHF7YMI/AAAAAAAAECQ/N_B1wq2UBwc/s400/IMG_3956.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
So all in all another pretty much perfect day...</span></span>
