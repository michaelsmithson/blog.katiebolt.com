Mort's hand went to the bag on his belt. <br>
'Hang on a minute,' he said. 'What happens then?' <br>
'What?' <br>
'I mean, is it my money or my life?' said Mort. 'That's the sort of thing robbers are supposed to demand. Your money or your life. I read that in a book once,' he added. <br>
'Possibly, possibly,' conceded the robber. He felt he was losing the initiative, but rallied magnificently. 'On the other hand, it could be your money </span></span><em><span><span style="font-size:x-small;">and</span></span></em><span><span style="font-size:x-small;"> your life.

On Boxing Day (after my darling cousin D and I braved the shops for the sales...yes, stupidest thing ever but I did get a new <a href="http://www.camelbak.com/sports-recreation/hydration-packs/2010-magic.aspx">camelbak</a> and a gorgeous dress) we attempted to see <a href="http://www.avatarmovie.com/index.html">Avatar</a> with my best friend B. I say attempted as the projector broke halfway through so we didn't get to see the second half. Oh well, I did get to see it all later but that is another story. We were pretty gutted so to make up for it I took them to </span></span><a href="http://veganrestaurant.co.nz/"><span><span>Golden Age</span></span></a><span><span> for dinner. We all picked one dish each to share between us all.</span></span></p>

<p>B picked the Sizzling Tofu...</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6Lz09OCLI/AAAAAAAADMM/R0NJk6CaAQY/s400/IMG_3119.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and you can even see the steam still rising off it in this photo!

<p>D picked the Lemon Veggie Chicken...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6L-3SS0CI/AAAAAAAADMU/CxQed_N0E3s/s400/IMG_3122.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...which is quite possibly my favourite dish there...if only it had some veges too! It's weird I like it so much because I'm not normally a huge fan of fake meat.

<p>Because neither of those dishes sounded like they had many (if any) vegetables I did the honourable thing and ordered the seasonal vegetable dish.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6L9WA2m4I/AAAAAAAADMQ/jihXgVJfHUc/s400/IMG_3121.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Here's my first plate with a bit of everything on rice.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6MAsqiP6I/AAAAAAAADMc/EL5dsaMry54/s400/IMG_3125.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There was quite a lot more consumed than this as we managed to devour all of what we ordered and then promptly went back to my place and ate leftovers from the desserts I made for Christmas day.

<p>And then a couple of days later it was off to <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Gisborne,+New+Zealand&amp;sll=-36.866443,174.772559&amp;sspn=0.044359,0.067806&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Gisborne,+New+Zealand&amp;ll=-37.879189,176.385498&amp;spn=2.800813,6.432495&amp;z=8">Gisborne</a> for New Years and the <a href="http://www.rhythmandvines.co.nz/">Rhythm &amp; Vines</a> music festival.</p>

There was the most awesome vegetarian food stall where we ate from every night called One Love. Oh man, their samosas were so amazing and they had these delicious potato fritters fried in some kind of spicy batter. I wish I had photos to show you but I forgot my camera.</span></span>

So much to talk about! This year is certainly starting off on a pretty exciting note! Anyway, where to start?! Right, I think we will travel back in time to 2009 for today before it all becomes a distant memory.</span></span></p>

<p>After our family Christmas party (but before Christmas itself) I went up to our beach house to get a bit of timeout and do some training. Here's a few photos of the sights experienced during some of my training sessions...</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6MTiZEVfI/AAAAAAAADMo/vgQyzGFBY2w/s400/IMG_3091.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>

Food was eaten of course. I had got some leftovers from the Christmas Party with me so that was the first night's dinner...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6Ln2heRnI/AAAAAAAADLg/8mLI3ZpRreE/s400/IMG_3079.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The next night I had some kind of curried lentil pie I'd got at the health food shop along with more kumara salad leftovers (which reminds me, I still haven't gotten the recipe off Mum to share with you guys).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6LskwL3YI/AAAAAAAADLo/50LdXKmTTBo/s400/IMG_3081.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And finally, tofu stir-fry with some kind of fresh turkish bread...delicious!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6LpuojbKI/AAAAAAAADLk/GkwQkzWmXTQ/s400/IMG_3103.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Christmas Day itself I didn't do so well of documenting! My flatmates thought it was quite funny I had stir-fry for breakfast but my body has been asking for strange things lately with the increase of training so I just tend to listen to what it wants. Then lunch at the parents was just salad sandwiches so nothing too exciting. But the evening...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6LxgBIFHI/AAAAAAAADLw/yIbyshYaQwM/s400/IMG_3117.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My lovely cousin and I decided to ditch dinner entirely and go straight for dessert! Above is blueberry cobbler veganised and adapted from a blackberry cobbler recipe my American sister sent me. SO good!

<p>We also had trifle...because it is D's favourite. We had the chocolate variant at the Christmas party so this time I made a basic one with a plain sponge and vanilla custard. D also brought round berry-flavoured lite licks ice cream which was divine.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6LuO-UZ8I/AAAAAAAADLs/0yhsPTJk3I4/s400/IMG_3114.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My bowl...there may have been more consumed than this...!

<p>Hmmmm...this post has got quite long already so you'll have to wait till next time to find out about after-Christmas adventures and food!</p></span></span>

They hit each other's bottoms, pinch each other's breasts, and dance for each other, arms flailing like snakes, hips like Arab belly dancers. Little girls dance as though they were born to seduce and wriggle across the floor with challenging looks and raised eyebrows. Even the old grannies test the water, but give up halfway, before the dance is over. The old magic is still there but they haven't got the stamina to see the dance out. <br>

Happy New Year!!! I hope everyone had an awesome time and that the year ahead is full of promise. Mine was spent having the time of my life down in Gisborne at the </span></span><a href="http://www.rhythmandvines.co.nz/"><span><span>Rhythm &amp; Vines</span></span></a><span><span> music festival. Seriously, best new years ever with some of the most awesome people in the whole world. It's been a pretty rough year but I've made it through and found my feet. This year is going to be my year!</span></span></p>

<p>I've got a heap of photos and stories from Christmas and all that (although I forgot to take my camera to Gisborne so will have to grab the photos off my flatmates) but that will wait. Right now I'm up north house-sitting at my mates' farm. It's like a little slice of paradise.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6Mc93XJWI/AAAAAAAADM4/XmV6yTnCRq8/s400/IMG_3137.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I arrived late this morning and after lunch (how can you not love that view?)...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7zd0_-f1I/AAAAAAAADOI/82TY0QNKxAU/s400/IMG_3148.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...I went for a cruise round their own personal mountain bike park! Yep, the property is pretty big and has an expansive, steep patch of (mostly) pine forest filled with mountain bike tracks. It's even been mapped (we use their property a bit for mountain bike orienteering).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6MayxLn1I/AAAAAAAADM0/G0I9s_DvArY/s400/IMG_3131.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

After the ride it was time for a dip in the pool and a bit of a nap. Their cats seemed to think that was a good idea too...here's one of them lazing around in the study!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7znsxUBjI/AAAAAAAADOU/b29zNKG1gIk/s400/IMG_3146.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then in the evening it was time to whip up some dinner. Feeling a bit tired (I think I'm still in recovery from the rather epic new years and an equally epic drive back yesterday afternoon) I didn't really have the energy for anything too exciting.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7zfS4-i3I/AAAAAAAADOM/IZgPatEgj2E/s400/IMG_3171.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

For some reason gingerbread always reminds me of Christmas so what perfect way to kick-start the lead up to the festive season than gingerbread waffles.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SxLQ8bdA7rI/AAAAAAAADAE/VkDN-udI0Sw/s400/IMG_2995.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I used the recipe from Vegan Brunch (but using half and half white and wholemeal flours) and served them with sliced banana and maple syrup. Perfect!

<p>One thing I absolutely love about Christmas time is Christmas cake! This year I found </p></span></span><a href="http://thehungryvegan.blogspot.com/2008/10/organic-vegan-christmas-cake.html"><span><span>this</span></span></a><span><span> recipe on </span></span><a href="http://thehungryvegan.blogspot.com/"><span><span>The Hungry Vegan</span></span></a><span><span> blog and thought I’d give it a go.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SzLsrejJR5I/AAAAAAAADLY/HiMyGOHr24U/s400/IMG_3045.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ended up over-cooking mine a bit since it needed quite a lot less time than the recipe said (well, mine did anyway...maybe it was my cake pan?) but it still turned out delicious.

<p>We also always have our family Christmas party the last Saturday before Christmas day. Being the only vegan or vegetarian in the family usually (one of my cousins is a vegetarian but she lives in Aussie) I always bring a main dish and my famous trifle (well, famous in our family anyway). I also bought hummus because, well, hummus rocks.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SzLsqdN6JjI/AAAAAAAADLU/Mst7UMNknYU/s400/IMG_3047.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The evening started with my Aunty’s rather strong (at least on an empty stomach) fruit cocktail. I could feel my head spinning after only a few sips!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SzLsmKWysaI/AAAAAAAADLE/Fh1ObROHAHY/s400/IMG_3049.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The last couple of years I’ve been making a tofukey for the main dish which is really delicious but I was kind of a bit on the busy side and figured it was time for a change. Instead I made a nut loaf adapted from a recipe I found in the <a href="http://www.australian-womens-weekly.com/catalogue/product/1066/3650">Australian Women’s Weekly Great Vegetarian Food</a> cookbook. I also made a tomato sauce to go with it.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SzLsnOipgnI/AAAAAAAADLI/jJrOCNyo6kY/s400/IMG_3066.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It didn’t stay together as well as usual but never mind ‘cause taste is more important! Here’s it messily plated up amongst other good food. Mum made this awesome kumara salad after I specially requested it. I really should get the recipe off her. But she was kind enough to let me take home all the leftovers which I steadily ate through over the following couple of days.

<p>Of course, no family Christmas party is complete without trifle! This year my cousin D requested the chocolate version.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SzLsoaKw6JI/AAAAAAAADLM/qfR02Xn4WVg/s400/IMG_3071.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It’s really very simple although takes a bit of time to make everything. First I make a basic chocolate cake which then gets sliced up and spread with jam and laid at the bottom of the serving dish. I then mash up a tin of berries and pour this over the top and then add fresh, chopped fruit (strawberries are great with chocolate). Finally I make a thick chocolate custard which gets cooled before putting on top of the dish and then you top that with chopped dark chocolate. Super rich but super tasty!

<p>Here’s my dessert bowl...</p>

...trifle, fruit salad, my Uncle’s apple crumble and my Mum’s Christmas pudding. And now I’m super full which is, of course, all part of the tradition!</span></span>

Ooo, today is a good day! I've just entered a longish adventure race in mid-January with a friend of mine so am very excited about that (yep, people do say I'm slightly crazy but everyone needs a slice of craziness in their lives). Better start getting my milage up in preparation! This is also my last day of work for the year (scary thought...not back till mid January unless something comes up earlier).</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, back to the food. It was my brother's birthday earlier in the week so naturally that called a celebration and cake.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SylXUcHOpYI/AAAAAAAADKM/diJMCs78lH4/s400/IMG_3019.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I made my go-to carrot cake from </span></span><a href="http://squirrelsvegankitchen.com/"><span><span>The Damn Tasty Vegan Baking Guide</span></span></a><span><span> (this time I used pear puree instead of apple sauce and dates instead of raisins) and, as usual, it was delicious and perfect. I love this recipe (if you don't have this book, it's </span></span><em><span><span>almost</span></span></em><span><span> identical to the one in Kris' other book, </span></span><a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/cookbook/"><span><span>100 Best Vegan Baking Recipes</span></span></a><span><span>).

<p>We had dinner at my parents house and I brought along some </p></span></span><a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/products/veg-express-sausage-rolls/"><span><span>Fry's vegetarian sausage rolls</span></span></a><span><span> to add to my dinner.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SylXTGLfoyI/AAAAAAAADKI/Qd_9lAfs7v0/s400/IMG_3022.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My cousin D decided she wanted to try a bit and reckoned they tasted remarkably like the real thing. I'm never sure if this is a good thing, a bad thing or just a thing but I guess if your average person thinks they taste good (whether it tastes like the real thing or not) then that's gotta be a good thing.

<p>Cake...good for my tummy!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SylXRiIx6pI/AAAAAAAADKA/8PZCsDaMBSA/s400/IMG_3025.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We've got our family Christmas party on Saturday night...ARGH!!! I can't believe how fast this year has gone. It's crazy. Feels like only a few months ago it was Christmas last year! Come back next time for lots of Christmas food...there are going to be a few busy days in the kitchen ahead.</span></span>

It was Mum's birthday on Saturday so, naturally, cake was required. But first up, dinner. Because everyone had been out all day the meal was real quick. Mum had got me </span></span><a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/products/veg-express-sausage-rolls/"><span><span>Fry's vegetarian sausage rolls</span></span></a><span><span> which were real delicious and I had that with a basic salad...because one must save room for cake!</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrXEFYXBXKI/AAAAAAAAC2k/LwlQsIpnj_M/s400/IMG_2721.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Mum always wants chocolate when asked so this time I thought, well, why don't I not ask her and make something else that I know she will love just as much but wouldn't think of to ask for because chocolate always gets in the way!!! You see, whilst browsing the recipes on Have Cake, Will Travel I stumbled across a recipe for </span></span><a href="http://havecakewilltravel.com/2007/08/12/lemony-french-cake/"><span><span>Lemony French Cake</span></span></a><span><span> which immediately made me think of Mum 'cause she loves lemon-flavoured cakes and puddings. I knew instantly this would be perfect for her.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrXEESzUbSI/AAAAAAAAC2g/9diewya1K2s/s400/IMG_2724.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I iced the cake with the cream cheese lemon icing and topped it with vegan lemon-flavoured turkish delight (another real favourite of Mum's). After an awesome day out at the forest for the Auckland Orienteering Champs (yep, my parents are orienteers too), cake was the perfect way to finish the day.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrXEDsWGF9I/AAAAAAAAC2c/QZcOdk6FihY/s400/IMG_2729.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It didn't rise as much as I would have liked which might be because I cooked it in a larger pan than the recipe called for but it was deliciously light and not too sweet. I'll definitely be making this cake again. Most importantly though, the birthday girl liked it too!</span></span>
