            <p></p><p><span style="font-size:x-small">"...silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly. — It depends upon the character of those who handle it." <br>
- <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen</span></p>

<p>Hello! We're busy playing the 'guess how big that aftershock was' game after a rather large shake (it knocked a few things out of our pantry so it's got to be at least a 5. Extra points for guessing where it was centred. You might laugh but some people had bets on one at work once!).</p>

<p>M and I have spent most of the day in a food coma after eating up large at the <a href="http://www.vegetarianexpo.org.nz/">vegetarian expo</a> and then eating lots of cake and bread at his parents' house (his Mum made this vegan orange cake especially for us. I think I'm going to have to get the recipe off her because it was delicious). I have to say though, a food coma is a bit more pleasant than the total exhaustion state we were both in last night after a rogaine based out of <a href="http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=castle+hill+village,+canterbury&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-43.206177,171.728668&amp;spn=0.670659,1.601257&amp;sll=-41.244772,172.617188&amp;sspn=43.960078,68.994141&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;hnear=Castle+Hill,+Canterbury&amp;t=h&amp;z=10">Castle Hill</a> (it was crazy - we started in a snowfall and finished in beautiful sunshine a few hours later!).</p>

<p>First up, before we even got inside, we got vegetarian sausages with all the trimmings (mustard, sweet chilli sauce, onions and tomato sauce). I devoured mine in no time because I was starving (only having an apple for breakfast will do that for you...but I was determined to eat far too much at the expo so had to make sure there was going to be room). I think the sausages they used were the <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/">Frys</a> ones. Later, inside the expo, I had a good chat to the people from Frys about their <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/products/frys-vegetarian/introducing-4-new-products/">new products</a> which are coming soon and I got all excited!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WTYi33zIDtQ/TpFhzK_bkKI/AAAAAAAAFNs/-jYpgLzd7iI/s640/food01.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Next up I got all excited by these tiny little cupcakes and the vegan society stall so I had to get one of the lemon ones. It was eaten in no time (you could have eaten the whole thing in one go but I tried to make it last a bit longer).

<p>I then downed a shot glass of vegan beer from the <a href="http://casselsbrewery.co.nz/">Cassels &amp; Sons Brewery</a>. Now that was quite nice and I might have to pop out there and get some but it was a bit early for me and alcohol to meet (11am). I think I got a whole lot more giggly after that.</p>

<p>Then it was time for some serious browsing of the stalls (while I giggled continuously and got all excited at the smallest of things). This didn't last all that long because I stumbled across another stall selling the most amazing looking vegan baking. <a href="http://www.catrescue.org.nz/">Cat Rescue Christchurch</a> had a big table filled with delicious-looking home baking but my eye was instantly caught by the ginger crunch so I had to have some of that.</p>

<p>After the mini sugar coma I was now in we decided something savoury was in order. We'd thought about pies but ended up going for samosas with chutney from, well I can't remember where from but they were delicious and very spicy.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8Ykh_XlfETM/TpFhz809jAI/AAAAAAAAFNw/hmP1Fcv_I8s/s640/food02.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Drink was definitely required after that but when we wandered over to The Lotus Heart stall I got carried away and ended up getting a slice of raw lemon cheesecake instead!! It was divine. They have got this whole raw dessert thing down to a T (or is it a little t? I've never written that phrase down before). Luckily M was a bit more sensible and bought us some sparkling orange and ginger drink to share.

<p>You'd think we'd be full by now but the pies were still calling. We ended up getting a Country Pie to share from the <a href="http://www.lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/">Linda McCartney Foods</a> stall. The pastry was delicious but the filling was slightly too 'meaty' for my taste. M seemed to like it though.</p>

<p>Then just to top it off, I'd come to the realisation I hadn't gotten anything chocolaty yet so I headed back to the lovely ladies at <a href="http://www.catrescue.org.nz/">Cat Rescue Christchurch</a>. I don't know who you ladies are but you do amazing work and are incredible bakers. When we have somewhere where I can have a cat I am totally heading your way. Anyway, I picked up a slice of peppermint chocolate cake which I picked at once we got home (it was incredible).</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pQQ0QMPZfZU/TpFhSaM8TCI/AAAAAAAAFNo/grZOVaeIJlE/s640/food03.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
So yeah, basically the vegetarian expo was awesome and I'm most grateful for the lady at work who told me about it. As you can probably guess by this post (and like I said on the feedback form afterwards), I was pretty much just there for the food and it did not disappoint.

<p>By the way, for those who were curious, the official quake magnitude is now up and it was a 5.5. Exciting!</p>

<p>Golly gosh, it's been an age since I've last posted! That snow I mentioned may not have come on Sunday but it sure was around by Monday. So much so that we couldn't get into work. Snow day!!!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-DQpYVuxauzo/Tkiv2WSsx5I/AAAAAAAAFLo/vR-W1hepxLM/s400/IMG_2189.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>

I wish I could tell you that I spent the day cooking and baking up a storm to keep us warm but instead I spent most of it on the couch or in bed horribly sick. Thankfully I managed to redeem myself today as snow blanketed the city yet again (I could get used to these long weekends!).

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pbocV-UbWfQ/TkiwIBCCklI/AAAAAAAAFL0/bGNJwT_Yc4M/s400/IMG_2418.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Look at the magic you encounter when you go running in the snow!</em></center> <br>
Cooking in my brand new fast slow cooker is a big pot of pumpkin, coconut and lentil soup (to go with five seed loaf from the breadmaker). I hope it works out because the instruction manual did my head in!

<p>M was cutting up part of a huge pumpkin for me to use in the soup but it was too much so I pondered what to do with the extra. In the end I boiled it up and then blended it to make a puree. Half went in the freezer but half went into a ginger and pumpkin loaf which has already been partly devoured. I am trying restrain myself from eating the whole damn thing right now!</p>

<strong>Gingery Pumpkin Bread</strong>
Adapted from a couple of recipes in Kris' <a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/cookbook/">The 100 Best Vegan Baking Recipes</a>.

<p>1 cup white flour <br>
1/2 cup wholemeal flour <br>
1 1/2 tsp baking soda <br>
2 tsp ginger <br>
1 tsp cinnamon <br>
1/2 tsp salt <br>
1 cup pumpkin puree <br>
1/4 cup oil <br>
1/4 cup apple puree <br>
1/2 cup brown sugar <br>
1/4 cup molasses <br>
1/3 cup milk (I used oat milk)</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C. Lightly grease a loaf tin (a smaller one is better since it doesn't get all that big).</p>

<p>In a large bowl mix together the flours, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon and salt. In another bowl whisk the pumpkin puree, oil, apple puree, brown sugar, molasses and milk together until smooth.</p>

<p>Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients and mix gently until just combined. Spoon into the loaf tin and bake for about 45-50 minutes until, well, done. It might take a tiny bit longer but our oven is fan-forced and I can't figure out how to stop it!</p>

<p>Leave in the tin for at least half an hour before turning out onto a cooling rack.</p>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size:x-small;">“...your kitchen looks like a bear came in search of honey.” <br>
- <em>Dead Reckoning</em> by Charlaine Harris</span></p>

<p>Right now I am buried deep in boxes after the truck came and dropped off all my stuff from Auckland. SO exciting! I am impatiently waiting for M to find something to prop the front of my bookcase up on (the floor is uneven) so I can unpack all my books. Impatient might be an understatement...</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-frWGDlem1UA/Thjmpl_AgcI/AAAAAAAAFIA/Mx1y6qcRmbA/s400/IMG_2102.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, a couple of weekends ago we invited M’s parents and sister round for dinner which was an awesome excuse to get my hands dirty doing some fun cooking. I really wanted to make bread from scratch which is something I haven’t really done before (apart from making pita bread once which is pretty fun). I had a recipe from my old flatmate which I was keen to try out so on Saturday afternoon I found myself elbow deep in flour! But it was all worth it because the bread came out divine.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qUb_c020p5c/ThjmraPPocI/AAAAAAAAFIE/mUx9DgagEeQ/s400/IMG_2103.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also really wanted to make corn chowder so I had a array of different ingredients I thought might possibly go in it but no real idea of what I was going to do. This seems to be a common theme of my cooking! I had browsed various recipes but nothing was quite what I wanted so I just made it up as I went along. There is onion, pumpkin, potato, celery, corn, coconut cream, veggie stock, sundried tomatoes, various spices among various other ingredients I can’t remember now. It all seemed too chunky for my liking once it was done though so I bizzed it up a tiny bit with the stick blender so there were still plenty of lumps but nothing too ginormous.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ADIW9kiSIbA/ThjmtKgVLDI/AAAAAAAAFII/k3NZbXm_kv8/s400/IMG_2104.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It ended up turning out delicious and served with the bread I was quite impressed with myself! We ended up eating way too much and getting super full...always a sign of a successful meal. But of course you have to have dessert. I had a whole lot of rhubarb in our freezer which M’s Mum had given us so I stewed that up with some apples and raisins and made a delicious crumble. So all in all it was the perfect winter feast.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SgB8Gc8XhW8/ThjmuedM0CI/AAAAAAAAFIM/1kKjMfbNG3Q/s400/IMG_2109.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Since then it’s got steadily colder. In fact they reckon there might be snow down to sea level tomorrow...I hope they are wrong! But now I have all my books so I guess it could be worse!</span></span>

- </span></span><em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sophie’s World</span></span></em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> by Jostein Gaarder</span>
<span> <br>
M and I moved house last weekend so now we have somewhere of our own which is terribly exciting. I mean, I have a fancy big fridge all to us and a kitchen that I can arrange any way that I like! And, at last, my cooking inspiration is slowly starting to come back again after what feels like forever (months? Years even?).</span></span></p>

<p>But our first meal at the new place was Hell pizza on the only furniture we’d moved at that stage...a table with a couple of chairs! I like to customise the Sinister pizza (which is naturally vegan but mixing the toppings up a little is always fun) and if you get the big one then you have leftovers for the following night when you’re too tired from moving to even contemplate cooking something proper.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Wr4V639eTgU/Thjmfnva3rI/AAAAAAAAFHk/HseCnL8ZQXg/s400/IMG_2076.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The first meal I actually cooked though was pretty boring but still delicious, tofu stir-fry with turkish bread. Always a good safe option especially when getting used to a new kitchen.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TsBYltuXovg/ThjmhNEErEI/AAAAAAAAFHo/WIAmRaG5O8c/s400/IMG_2086.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I think I spent half the time trying to remember where I'd put everything and getting used to the fridge being in the laundry. Sounds weird but it actually works fine and that means we have more space in the kitchen.

<p>Next up is a rice and veggie casserole which is based on the Cheezy Broccoli and Rice Casserole from The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook. I liked the concept of this and the taste was pretty awesome too but there was far too much rice to veggies even though I had added more veggies than the recipe originally said. Although I didn't have a cup measure and I think the cup I used for the rice was, well, definitely larger than your average! But still, it definitely needs some modification to reach a level of awesomeness!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-adJPPuq_mOw/Thjmi-8pboI/AAAAAAAAFHs/0PbSaTTMBbo/s400/IMG_2087.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yes, it looks quite good in the photo above but the veggies (and beans) are all on the top and the rice is all underneath in a thick mass.

<p>Another night I made a delicious wintery scone-topped casserole (you can tell it's pretty wintery round here by these last two dishes...-3 the other morning when we biked to work!). This has to be one of my favourite winter dishes and you can make it with pretty much anything you have on hand.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EvWu4E4-hrM/Thjmm8fmbcI/AAAAAAAAFH4/5Vd_So0Pn_s/s400/IMG_2095.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The casserole part of this dish has onion, carrot, cauliflower, celery, pumpkin and tinned sweetcorn with a tin of butter beans and a creamy sauce (pretty much just oat milk, flour and sweet chilli sauce). You cook all that up then dollop spoonfuls of scone mixture on top and bake for about 15 minutes at a super hot temperature. Voila, an awesome winter dish that is also brilliant the next day or even frozen.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L5-ckzjRoAo/ThjmoE5aQLI/AAAAAAAAFH8/OWcR_BlRjgA/s400/IMG_2097.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, that's enough food for now. I am so tired! It's been so busy since moving and last night we had M's parents over for an awesome feast (which I will blog about shortly) and today we went for a lovely bike ride (route is </span></span><a href="http://nz.mapometer.com/en/cycling/route_1375407.html"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>) so I feel about ready to fall asleep on my seat. I wish we had a couch!

<p>Oh, and for anyone interested, our new flat is in the white zone which means it hasn’t been assessed yet but I can’t see any reason for it to be classed as orange or red so I think we’re pretty safe. It’s got the usual cracks that every house in this city now has but it all seems pretty superficial. If you are interested, there is more information about the zones </p></span></span><a href="http://www.landcheck.org.nz/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>. It is about whether the land is safe to live on rather than whether the structures themselves are safe (that’s different again - but appears to have a similar colour scheme as far as I can tell).</span></span>

<p>I have tried to write this post so many times but it never comes out right or I think no one would be interested or it just ends up so long and twisty that I give up. But in the end I thought perhaps you might be more interested than I thought or that at least sometimes it is helpful so say what you need to say (even if it bores everyone else to tears)...</p>

<p>Last Monday started out like any other day. It didn't stay that way however. It was just after 1pm when we got the first big earthquake (a 5.6 I think) which had us diving under our desks. It wasn't long after we'd all managed to calm down and get back to work again that the 6.3 struck. The sounds are the most frightening to me. The groaning and grumbling of the earthquake itself, the collective holding of breath (which has a sound presence that is impossible to explain), panicked screaming, the rattling of, well, everything...and then the silence. That small moment of time feels like a lifetime. Then everything else gets broken down into tiny segments of memories.</p>

<p>I remember the terrible smell of chlorine spilling out of the cracks that formed in the spa pool outside. I remember seeing the birds flying manically through the sky in all sorts of directions and in huge flocks. I remember eating handfuls of licorice allsorts that the boss had taken out of his freezer (and wondering why he would keep them in there), not caring they weren't vegan. I just wanted something.</p>

<p>I remember drinking fancy wine out of a fancy glass while sitting outside in my fluro bike jacket and my helmet.  I remember needing to use the bathroom but not knowing what I was supposed to do so just waiting and waiting. I remember our company director lifting my bike over the security fence which we couldn't get open because it needed power. I remember biking slowly through the park in an attempt to not to get sprayed by the liquefaction but wishing I could bike faster because I had visions of trees falling on me. I remember the dust and the queues of cars and getting lost on my way home when I found I couldn't take my usual route. I remember the poor lady at the traffic lights who spoke like someone had taken the bottom out of her world but that I just wanted to get away from her and the doom and gloom and get home.</p>

<p>I remember sitting in a doorframe near the front door at home worried about M because I couldn't get hold of him (despite knowing he would be fine) and holding my cellphone really tight in the hope that someone might magically realise I needed some company. And then just as it was becoming unbearable there was a knock on the door and our neighbour, who I'd never met, was there asking me if I was okay and if I wanted to come over to his house until people got home. I remember listening to his windup radio and being unable to sit still while he calmly cleaned up the mess in his kitchen.</p>

<p>I remember the relief to see familiar faces as everyone came home or popped over to make sure we were all okay. I remember the power coming on just after dark and sitting inside, still in my fluro jacket, watching the news on our warped television screen. I remember not wanting to be alone and wanting to keep everyone here I cared about in the room with me. I remember wondering how it was possible to be so tired but so unable to sleep. I remember crying and wondering why. I remember being alive. It was never in doubt that M and I would be okay but the magical feeling of surviving is amazing.</p>

<p>Anyway, in case you have managed to read down this far I do have something for you...on the day before the earthquakes I made myself an oatmeal cake for breakfast before going orienteering. It was super delicious, especially with soy yoghurt and because I am awesome I even have a recipe for you (based on the ones <a href="http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2010/11/11/check-out-my-oatmeal-cake/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>).</span></span></p>

1/2 cup wholegrain oats <br>
a pinch of salt <br>
1/2 tsp cinnamon <br>
1/4 tsp ginger <br>
1/2 a banana, mashed <br>
3 Tbsp oat milk (well, any non-dairy milk) <br>
1/2 Tbsp oil <br>
1 Tbsp golden syrup <br>
2 Tbsp peanut butter (or other nut butter) <br>
1 small handful of chopped walnuts <br>
1 small handful raisins (or chopped dates or something similar if you don't like raisins)

<p>Preheat the oven to 190°C.</p>

<p>Combine the dry ingredients, then mix in the wet ingredients.</p>

<p>Spoon into a greased ramekin (about 1 cup I think) and cook for about 20-25 minutes until it's firm(ish).</p>

<p>Let sit for about 5 minutes then tip out onto your plate and hope for the best (you may need to run a knife around the side)!</p></span></span>

            <p></p><p><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">...either too many words to an idea or not enough furniture for the idea itself or somebody else's furniture; always a muddle and clutter of speech. <br>
- </span><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">Towards Another Summer</span></em><span style="font-size: x-small;"> by Janet Frame</span>
<span> <br>
I am home alone tonight and it's all dark and cold outside. M is out of town for work and my other flatmate is, well, out somewhere. I don't really like being home alone even when it's light. It's not that I can't entertain myself. More that I just like to know there are other people around. I could do with some chocolate but there is none...very silly I know!!</span></span></p>

<p>Since I'm feeling a little down I'll tell you a little about a couple of my favourite meals that I've been having a lot since I got down here. I've always loved nachos (well, at least in the last few years) but the way I've made them has changed over time. I found <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/10/try-not-talking.html"><span><span>this old post </span></span></a><span><span>from 2008 where you can barely see the bean mix under all the vegan cheese! But here is a plate of nachos from the other week...and I think this is the best version so far.</span></span></p>

Everyone else was having sour cream so I got a little jealous and thought I'd try some hummus instead and it worked really well!

<p>Another favourite is, well, a sandwich. Makes a great dinner when you fry up some tofu, spinach and mushrooms. Makes an even better dinner when you've been at the climbing wall for the last few hours, it's gotten super late and you are really hungry.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-NHvEhBER448/Te8-DPmsWMI/AAAAAAAAFGs/eP9iZwQdXrE/s400/IMG_1796.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There is something about toasting the bread that takes it from being lunch food to super awesome dinner food...kind of weird but true.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-rc00oB0tAyI/Te87oB5zckI/AAAAAAAAFGE/fEOl5pGkXus/s400/IMG_1815.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I have also had a lot of tofu (and veggie burger) sandwiches for lunch lately...well, especially since starting my new job last week. ARGH!!! Can't believe I have a job! But it has made life even more of a whirlwind of madness than it was before...but life is still amazing.
