- Thou wilt get a brush and a little chalk to my sword - 'Twill be only in your honour's way, replied Trim.

</span></span><em><span><span style="font-size:x-small;">(and yes, that is the entirety of chapter 29)</span></span></em><span> <br>
<span> <br>
Look! It's me! I'm still alive!</span></span></p>

<p>Seriously, I have all these half-finished posts that haven't made it up because, well, I've ended up super super busy. Life can do that to you sometimes.</p>

<p>On my bench at the moment I have a whole lot of lemon shortbread cookies cooling for our work morning tea tomorrow. We are having a British themed morning since it's Queens Birthday this long weekend in New Zealand (it's not actually the Queen's birthday since that's in April sometime I think, but this is when we celebrate it). No photos of them yet but they do taste super delicious even slightly warm and still a bit soft!</p>

<p>But I do have cookies for you today. Even a recipe. This is an adaption of a recipe my old flatmate would make all the time. She would try all these different versions and we'd all get to taste test them. I was feeling a little homesick the day I made these and it cheered me up thinking heaps.</p>

<p>Anyway, I also made them the day before this crazy 24 race (eventually there will be a post for this and many others <a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/">here</a> when i come up for air again) the weekend after I arrived so I could have something yummy to eat in between legs and to warm my heart when the rest of me was freezing (and grumpy)!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C6R6SPpRdFM/TedidQORo_I/AAAAAAAAFFo/FethbUeRFSk/s400/IMG_1711.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ate at least 10 on the first day of the race (and a few more on the following day although I was slightly over cookies by then).

</span></span><strong><span><span>HyunJin's Magical Cookies</span></span></strong><span><span> (my chocolate, walnut and sultana version) <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>I got about 24 quite large cookies out of this recipe...and they are far yummier than they look!</span></span></em><span><span>

<p>2/3 cup vegan margarine (I used olivani or whatever it's called) <br>
1 scant cup brown sugar <br>
2 Tbsp golden syrup <br>
1 1/2 cups flour <br>
1 1/2 cups oats <br>
1 1/2 tsp baking powder <br>
pinch of salt <br>
80g chopped walnuts <br>
1/2 cup sultanas (or raisins or currants or chopped dates etc) <br>
1/2 cup dark chocolate, chopped</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 170Â°C. Line a couple of trays with baking paper.</p>

<p>Slowly melt the margarine, sugar and golden syrup in a big pot over the stove. Take the pot off the heat and mix in the flour, oats, baking powder and salt. Stir in the walnuts, sultanas and chocolate.</p>

<p>Place spoonfuls of mixture onto the baking trays with a bit of space between each. Lightly flatten (not too much). Bake for, hmmm, about 12 minutes or something like that. Just don't overdo them. That's all!!</p>

So the other day I was out exploring the </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Hills"><span><span>Port Hills</span></span></a><span><span> and I couldn't help but think about what a beautiful city I live in...as if I hadn't already worked that one out! It reminded me of the nice chat I had with the lady serving me at the chemist today.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TdSTtMkxQ0I/AAAAAAAAFEo/X-nztDLJfog/s400/IMG_1770.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>Looking down over my new city from Summit Road</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
Down the bottom of the valley there was some pretty impressive rockfall which I briefly considered taking some photos of but my desire not to hang around was stronger! Most of the time I don't feel fazed by earthquakes (I was in the process of joining the library earlier this week when there was a rather large shake and we all just carried on with life as though it wasn't happening - the guy signing me up didn't even bat an eyelid) but every now and then I get a little panicked and this was one of those moments...and I didn't even require the earth to shake!

<p>But since you are normally here to see some food I will oblige with some chocolate. </p></span></span><a href="http://www.whittakers.co.nz/#/products/blocks/ghanapeppermint1/"><span><span>Whittaker's Ghana Peppermint</span></span></a><span><span> chocolate to be exact (man, their new website makes me crave chocolate really bad). This was the chocolate I carried with me on the plane here in case I needed that support that only chocolate can give! One of my old flatmates told me that even the Wilderness magazine says you should not leave home without chocolate so it must be as magical as I always thought!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TdXY1k-61II/AAAAAAAAFE8/BS7vOLmHilc/s400/IMG_1671.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I totally adore this chocolate. In fact, it is dangerous to have around. I gave a block to my parents once. They said never again. It's that, well, "bad" for us peppermint lovers!! Of course, if you are trying to avoid eating it you could just make </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/12/minty-christmas.html"><span><span>mint slice</span></span></a><span><span> with it right?</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Youâre off to Great Places! <br>
Today is your day! <br>
Your mountain is waiting. <br>
Soâ¦get on your way! <br>

<span><span> <br>
So, I did say there was some big stuff happening and today is the big day! Today I will be on a plane moving to Christchurch. Depending on who you talk this is either exciting, crazy (often rephrased in a more positive light as brave) or scary. Or a combination. I think it's exciting although I have been through the whole range of emotions in the last few weeks (especially in the last few days). Despite the earthquake and everything sometimes you've just got to dive into life no matter what.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TcDUIeiVmfI/AAAAAAAAFD0/AeNKYKg3pIU/s400/IMG_1387.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, because I am the most useless blogger ever I have no photos of my awesome leaving meals but I will tell you about them anyway! First up was a lovely evening hanging out with my cousins and watching a bit of the royal wedding. We ordered rather excessive amounts of pizza from </span></span><a href="http://hellpizza.com/nz/"><span><span>Hell</span></span></a><span><span> and my aunty made a delicious crumble. Yay!

<p>There was also my last day of work where my boss took me out for lunch at </p></span></span><a href="http://www.landrethandco.co.nz/"><span><span>Landreth &amp; Co</span></span></a><span><span> on Ponsonby Road. The lady at the counter was super helpful at working out what they could make for me and I ended up with a huge bowl of pasta with bountiful amounts of tomato, spinach and basil. It was so good. We also got through two bowls of fries. Is that bad to admit? It was 3pm by the time we had lunch though...!!

<p>But the most exciting and awesome meal was my farewell dinner at the flat! My flatmates are so awesome and put together the coolest dinner ever. Basically it was make your own rice paper rolls but the spread of things we could put in them was incredible. So many different veggies and fruit as well as rice noodles, tofu and sauces. I ate so many it was a bit ridiculous. Then for dessert I made the Mocha Melt Cake (but gluten-free for the lovely H) from </p></span></span><a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/cookbook/"><span><span>Have Your Cake and Eat It Too</span></span></a><span><span> (in the rice cooker!!!) which I served with banana ice cream (frozen bananas, a bit of soy milk and vanilla essence all blended up together...SO good). I am really going to miss all these guys. Best flat and flatmates in the entire world. Ever. Seriously.

<p>And then (because I can't stay away) I ended up back at my flat for my final night in Auckland because, well, I really didn't want to say goodbye! They cooked up this awesome Indian curry along with a beautiful dahl soup which I will have to attempt to recreate at some point. It was perfect. And then I rushed out before any of us could start crying!! From one home to another...</p>

<p>So the next post will be from my new home!! How cool is that?!</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
AGES ago (as in way back in January when I was back in Christchurch...although at least we are in the same year) B and I went to the </span></span><a href="http://www.welcomecafe.co.nz/"><span><span>Welcome Chinese Vegetarian Cafe</span></span></a><span><span> for dinner. I just did a quick check and yes, it is one of the few vegetarian restaurants that have managed to open after the earthquake. So go there if you are in Christchurch because they make great food.</span></span></p>

<p>I can't remember anything that we ordered so you'll just have to make do with the pictures!!! It was all delicious but as usual, too much food but better too much than too little!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TX8vP-x0OWI/AAAAAAAAE68/qDf8EKlDV4c/s400/IMG_4639.JPG" alt="" title="">

I have to admit that once I got home though I was really feeling the lack of vegetables in the dishes we'd chosen. Hmmm, my tastebuds have certainly changed over time!

<p>Back up in Auckland and only a couple of weeks ago </p></span></span><span><span>I went to a vegetarian Indian restaurant with a couple of friends, </span></span><a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews.php?id=19895"><span><span>Jai Jalaram Khaman</span></span></a><span><span> after my flatmates raved about the place.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TX8tqsVG08I/AAAAAAAAE6s/61MyniPq5mw/s400/IMG_4664.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ordered a thali (most options were vegan apparently) and also got some other random dish on the side that I forgot to photograph because clearly the lady serving us felt sorry for me not being able to sample on of my friend's dishes. It was good, whatever it was though! Actually, all the food was really delicious but again I came home really feeling the lack of vegetables. I think there might be something wrong with me!</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
So...I'm getting quite bad at this blogging thing and right now things are feeling more than a little stressful which is all rather understandable but doesn't change the fact that I have a whole lot of friends trying to live in a city that pretty much resembles a war zone. But I did have a beautiful weekend. M managed to fly up from Christchurch on Friday night (he requested that I bring water and food to the airport - just a hint at how desperate things are </span></span><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake"><span><span>down there</span></span></a><span><span>) and was quite excited about having a shower since his place was still without water. After M showered and we had dinner we escaped up to my beach house for the weekend.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7vWZmu5yI/AAAAAAAAE44/yERIufm5aPA/s400/110226_135310.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Somehow Auckland managed to turn on a beautiful fine weekend with no rain whatsoever which is a bit of a miracle! After lazying about and sleeping in (felt like the first time in ages) and going for a paddle on our archaic (but totally awesome) polystyrene surfboards and swimming I made us lunch...hummus, tomato and mushroom toasted sandwiches with a red cabbage coleslaw (recipe to come).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7vW3NAtjI/AAAAAAAAE48/RgBa_px7VQs/s400/110226_141607.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
After lunch we did a bit more lazing about because we could and then wandered up the hill for some fresh air. The view from the top is always incredible (not that the view from out our front door isn't though!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7xcPQT9EI/AAAAAAAAE5g/MyVc_0lK4DA/s640/110226_164528%20Panorama.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then I made us an awesome green curry packed full of veggies, chickpeas and butter beans (my new favourite bean) on brown rice. We both went back for seconds.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7vcA86gxI/AAAAAAAAE5A/6nhTr4GCNlw/s400/110226_191752.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I actually had some bananas I hadn't got around to eating or freezing (this is quite rare since I normally pretty much buy bananas, deliberately leave them on the bench for a couple of days and then freeze to make smoothies) so I decided I was going to make us banana bread. The one from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/veganomicon-the-ultimate-vegan-cookbook/"><span><span>Veganmicon</span></span></a><span><span> to be specific. I think I've got it down pat now and it's my favourite. It even toasts quite well a couple of days later too.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7vdKLgmMI/AAAAAAAAE5E/6x35W9wV0sc/s400/110226_212120.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We had a slice each for dessert straight from the oven and then pretty much devoured the rest the following day. SO good! Of course, we needed delicious banana bread to fuel us for a run in the hot sun over in Tawharanui...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7veldzefI/AAAAAAAAE5M/Gnf5ohgQOwk/s400/110227_094149.jpg" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>Apparently I am in this photo as a tiny wee pink dot halfway up the hill but I am too small to really make out</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
And then all too quickly it was time to go home again and for M to head back to Christchurch. It felt even harder than normal to see him go...</span></span>

Things have been busy and now things are just plain </span></span><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake?label=Christchurch+quake"><span><span>overwhelming and scary</span></span></a><span><span>. It all seems so surreal. Everyone I know in Christchurch is okay but that doesn't really make it that much better. I can't help worrying about M and all my friends. I just want them here and safe. Makes being at work seem completely irrelevant.</span></span></p>

<p>But you've got to try and keep your spirits up so here is the cake I made for a combined birthday party we had in Christchurch a few weeks ago for M and our friends.</p>

</span></span><em><span><span>This is before the cake made it to the party hence the awesome kitchen bench background</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
We ran around outside doing a crazy orienteering course, we ate lots of delicious food and even more delicious cake and we danced to awesome 80s music until I was too tired to stand up any more. Beautiful memories.</span></span>
