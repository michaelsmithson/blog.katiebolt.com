<span><span> <br>
Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day hands down. I can have it at any time of the day, doesn't really matter as long as it's breakfast food!</span></span></p>

<p>When I'm at home for breakfast (which seems to be only about 2 or 3 times a week at the moment) I normally have cereal and fruit. It's regular comfort food (I've been known to have the odd day where I've had this for lunch and/or dinner as well!).</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sp3XCCjp-3I/AAAAAAAACwI/z0nbJmJsHIA/s400/IMG_2609.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My regular at the moment is a couple of weetbix, a handful of muesli (what ever I've got in the pantry at the time), a golden kiwifruit and a spoonful of peanut butter doused in heaps of rice milk. This will keep me going until lunchtime no problem.

<p>Sometimes on a Saturday morning I might have a smoothie before yoga if I haven't been out running beforehand (I'm normally way behind schedule if I've gone running so it's cereal or a muesli bar as I'm racing out the door).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdmdZlnCI/AAAAAAAACxQ/JVq0Wl9OYRI/s400/IMG_2631.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Sometimes it's a green smoothie, sometimes it's just your regular as above (frozen banana, frozen mixed berries, peanut butter, ground flaxseed, rice milk). I like it thick enough to eat with a spoon!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrfnqZ4pAeI/AAAAAAAAC2s/u1nUQIce4BQ/s400/IMG_2733.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This morning I didn't feel like my usual weetbix so I made a super thick smoothie so it was a bit more like ice cream and I ate it out of a bowl topped with muesli and chopped almonds and walnuts. SO delicious!

<p>If I'm having breakfast at work (the mornings I'm training before work) I'll have a homemade texas muffin and fruit (my favourites are the </p></span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/07/waking-up-and-eating.html"><span><span>Blueberry Ginger Spelt Muffins</span></span></a><span><span> and the </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/09/turning-up-heat.html"><span><span>Zucchini Spelt Muffins</span></span></a><span><span> both from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/vegan-brunch.html"><span><span>Vegan Brunch</span></span></a><span><span>) or toast (homemade bread...I love my breadmaker!) with almond butter and jam.

<p>There are times though when I'll put on my apron (metaphorically speaking since my apron normally hangs forlornly in my bedroom and my clothes bear the brunt of my messiness) and make something more exciting. Unfortunately I've had a fair amount on lately so haven't had time in the morning to make something exciting like waffles or pancakes...hopefully this weekend? Can't wait to make those </p></span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/08/bullet-proof-food-and-toasted-memories.html"><span><span>Peanut Butter Waffles</span></span></a><span><span> or some </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/09/in-search-of-perfection.html"><span><span>girdle scones</span></span></a><span><span> again though...

<p>Sometimes though I might even go out for breakfast/brunch/a meal before midday. </p></span></span><a href="http://www.kokako.co.nz/"><span><span>Kokako</span></span></a><span><span> is just up the road from my gym so sometimes I might head there on a Saturday or Sunday morning for some fueling up.

This is their tofu scramble and it is really good...tofu chunks, tomato, mushrooms, potato and super grainy bread. Guaranteed to make your morning.</span></span>

They totally rocked so I guess I'll have to give the recipe a go myself now!

<p>Another tofu dish she made was this...a baked tortilla stack. I think it's from one of the Simon and Alison Holst <a href="http://www.holst.co.nz/Portal.asp?contentid=39&amp;nextscreenid=201.102.103.101&amp;categoryid=11&amp;screenid=201.102.101.101&amp;sessionx=0C0390EE-2562-4EEC-AA10-56AB1ABE89F9">Meals Without Meat</a> cookbooks.

There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well adjusted family can't cope with. There is also no problem about changing the course of history - the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end. <br>

<p>Scoring free bittersweet <a href="http://www.whittakers.co.nz/"><span><span>Whittakers</span></span></a><span><span> chocolate from the boys at the coffee shop across the road from work. They definitely know how to brighten a bad day.</span></span></p>

Running especially as it becomes lighter in the mornings and I can run round the local parks instead of having to stick to the streets. It's even better when I have new running shoes (and having them contain some of my favourite colours). This morning it was light enough not long after 6am to run through the bush tracks in the </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Domain"><span><span>Auckland Domain</span></span></a><span><span>. Yay!

Finding Vanilla Tofutti Cuties at the </span></span><a href="http://www.choosecrueltyfree.org.nz/"><span><span>Safe</span></span></a><span><span> store on K'Rd. This is the kind of thing I never thought we'd get here. I seriously could not believe how awesome these tasted. Hopefully we will get a few more flavours.

Being out in the forest even on drizzly, wet days. Clears your head and frees your mind. My favourite thing to do out at the forest is orienteering...can't wait for the events this weekend.

<span><span> <br>
If I haven't thought in advance (which is pretty much all the time...and if I have planned in advance I'll have forgotten what I planned), I never know what I'm going to have for dinner until I actually get into the kitchen and have a rummage around for what I've got and what I feel up to doing. This particular dinner was a case of opening the pantry and going, umm, what shall I eat tonight? I saw a can of creamed corn and thought, 'hmmm, corn fritters sound good.' But I thought I'd add some chickpeas to the mix for some protein (and 'cause chickpeas are delicious).</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqjGY6UR6hI/AAAAAAAAC0E/njn__NomBT0/s400/IMG_2676.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I served the fritters with mango chutney, sliced capsicum and avocado, steamed broccoli with tahini ('cause I can never be bothered making a proper sauce), hummus and the last raw flaxseed cracker from a pack I bought at </span></span><a href="http://www.huckleberryfarms.co.nz/"><span><span>Huckleberry Farms</span></span></a><span><span> out of curiosity. Quick and delicious.

<p>In case you were interested, here's a really rough recipe for the fritters. Bear in mind I didn't actually measure anything but it's pretty forgiving so you can pretty much do what ever you like.</p>

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span>Corn and Chickpea Fritters</span></span></strong><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>half a can of chickpeas (drained) <br>
half a can of creamed corn <br>
½ tsp baking powder
approx ¹⁄₈ cup polenta <br>
approx ³⁄₈ cup wholemeal flour <br>
1 Tbsp yeast flakes <br>
1 Tbsp sweet chilli sauce <br>
½ Tbsp ground flaxseed mixed with 1 Tbsp rice milk
a sprinkling of chilli and lime seasoning</span></span></em><span><span>

<p>Mash the chickpeas up with a fork then mix in the rest of the ingredients (super easy!). Heat up your fry pan and spoon heaped tablespoons of the mixture into the pan once it's heated. Flatten slightly. Cook on both sides until golden brown (or just brown...I put the golden part in there 'cause it sounded fancy!). Makes enough for 2 people (and it keeps in the fridge for a couple of days as well...it might keep longer but my mixture never lasts that long!).</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
A new vegan restaurant, </span></span><a href="http://www.veganrestaurant.co.nz/menu.html"><span><span>Golden Age</span></span></a><span><span>, opened in Auckland a few weeks ago which is a pretty big deal because it's actually the first purely vegan restaurant to open in New Zealand. Naturally as soon as I heard about it (thanks </span></span><a href="http://aucklandvegan.wordpress.com/"><span><span>Auckland Vegan</span></span></a><span><span> for the </span></span><a href="http://aucklandvegan.wordpress.com/2009/09/07/cake-at-golden-age/"><span><span>heads up</span></span></a><span><span>) I had to go check it out and my friend E decided to join me. We ordered heaps 'cause, well, it was all terribly exciting (for me anyway). I've never been to a restaurant or cafe where I can have absolutely anything on offer.</span></span></p>

<p>First up E picked the Sichuan Hot and Sour Soup.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqorXKSWpsI/AAAAAAAAC0M/WFirJu4rt9s/s400/IMG_2680.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I actually only had a spoonful of this 'cause I'm not a big fan of this kind of soup but I can vouch for the fact it was hot...in more ways than one! But E seemed to enjoy it and was determined to polish off the whole bowl (which was bigger than it first appeared).

<p>Next we had two main courses between us with rice (not pictured 'cause you all know what a plate of rice looks like!). E picked the Combination Tofu.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqorYF10NnI/AAAAAAAAC0Q/qzTTHlk46qs/s400/IMG_2681.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Your standard fare...but good all the same especially the veges for some reason, maybe because they weren't overcooked and still had a little bit of crunch to them.

<p>I um-ed and ah-ed for ages but eventually picked the Lemon Veggie Chicken.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqorY55eRlI/AAAAAAAAC0U/o48tQPdsFOY/s400/IMG_2683.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was SO delicious...I was quite taken by surprise really. How do you describe it? Hmmm...so good that it HAD to be bad for you! No idea if it tasted anything like chicken but I do know I will order it again.

<p>Of course dessert was a requirement so we got an almond cookie (I'm just guessing the flavour here but that's what it tasted like).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqorauamxSI/AAAAAAAAC0c/-J1rPHZfHQA/s400/IMG_2684.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Crunchy and not too sweet. Very delicious.

<p>Lastly we had to get a Red Bean Pancake to share...naturally.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqorZunNjzI/AAAAAAAAC0Y/B5QrKMjooBM/s400/IMG_2686.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I adored this which wasn't really surprising as ever since I had my first one a couple of months back I've fallen in love although it could have done with a little bit more red bean mixture inside. Now I've just got to work out how to make them myself!</span></span>

I'd never had a protein bar before but I saw these at the health food store and thought I'd try some since none of the usual ones I get in race packs and that I've seen people have are vegan.</span></span></p><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><strong><span><span><center>Peanut Butter Crunch</center></span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SoyndFzsD5I/AAAAAAAAClc/cCKbm87akLg/s400/IMG_2541.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I don't know what I expected it to be like but it tasted very strongly of peanut butter...kind of like eating it straight out of the jar mixed with sugar. It also felt like it was sticking to the roof of my mouth which wasn't that pleasant (yes, I was drinking plenty of water too). I think I'd rather just eat the peanut butter (natural peanut butter though 'cause this tastes a bit more processed). I will admit that it took the shakiness out of my legs after the race but hey, I suspect anything would have considering I hadn't eaten for about 4 hours and I'd just run solid for 3. Perhaps I should have had some out there on the course to see what it was like but my stomach is not big on eating whilst racing.

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span><center>Chocolate Brownie</center></span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sp7c1udZImI/AAAAAAAACwk/N9ENIo_9Nbw/s400/IMG_2612.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This flavour was much better for me. This time I tried it before heading out for a run after work. It wasn't too sweet and had a bit of crunch to it and more than held me over till I got around to making dinner (actually, I wasn't hungry at all when I got back which was good as I didn't end up eating until about 8:30pm). I wonder if it feels left out being the only one without </span></span><em><span><span>Crunch</span></span></em><span><span> in its name...?!

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span><center>Berry Almond Crunch</center></span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqjGZtjq96I/AAAAAAAAC0I/YcOPhRhNS8w/s400/IMG_2678.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Again I had this bar before heading out for a run after work that evening. I didn't have high expectations of it but it turned out to be pretty good...at least for the first half until it got a bit sweet. The berry taste wasn't too sickly and the almonds gave it a nice crunch and subtle nutty taste. It definitely held me over until dinner which was pretty late and it didn't sit in my stomach the way some bars do while I run but I still preferred the Chocolate Brownie flavour.

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span><center>Almond Crunch</center></span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRd4biwphI/AAAAAAAACxo/yAwpAg3v6CQ/s400/IMG_2638.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Maybe it was because I didn't drink enough water but I found this bar a little hard to stomach. It was quite sticky like the peanut butter flavour and had a fairly strong taste of almond essence. Now I love almonds and I adore almond butter but I'm not a fan of almond essence so I was kind of disappointed. I tried this bar midway through biking out at the </span></span><a href="http://www.bikepark.co.nz/"><span><span>Woodhill Bike Park</span></span></a><span><span> and it held me over till I got home again but I was starving not long after walking in the door.
