It was the question which, sooner or later, every child in the kingdom asks his governess or his schoolmaster or his parent. Yet the learned members of the York society did not at all like hearing it asked and the reason was this: they were no more able to answer it than any one else. <br>

<span><span> <br>
I've posted about </span></span><a href="http://www.thebluebird.co.nz/"><span><span>The Blue Bird</span></span></a><span><span> several times before but it always deserves more mention as it is probably our flat's favourite place to eat out.When you walk in there is a cabinet filled with food (all helpfully labelled). It's always a surprise to see what they have (my flatmates and I have our favourite items that we're always on the lookout for and will bring back for each other if we see them).</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SoynXAjzoRI/AAAAAAAAClM/LZ2-2AZByCo/s400/IMG_2528.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is a Potato and Pea Rissole with chutney and salad. Pretty simple but real good.

<p>I think this is a Pumpkin and Red Lentil Pie topped with strips of raw carrot and beetroot.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SOlVqUxPJzI/AAAAAAAABWY/KImG0IJKE3k/s400/IMG_0818.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Whatever it was, it tasted damn good. I really like their pastry. We actually have a couple of Sri Chinmoy recipe books sitting around at the flat and I keep meaning to pull them out and cook up a storm but I've been a bit lazy. I ought to change this!

<p>You can also order off their bowl menu...pick a size (small, medium, large...anything over a small is actually pretty large) a topping and then pick a base from brown rice, baked or mashed potato or baked kumara. It's served with a slice of grain bread and olivani (you have to ask for it instead of butter) on the side.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SnIbuAkhNPI/AAAAAAAACbs/EKp5qnJKfEo/s400/IMG_2455.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is their African Beans on kumara. It would be better with a few veges but it's pretty good (and an awesome protein powerhouse).

<p>They've recently started serving what they call superfood smoothies.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SoynYtDonwI/AAAAAAAAClQ/ZsHT6UAAOLk/s400/IMG_2531.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is the Maca Cacao smoothie in all its chocolaty goodness. Can't remember what was in it but it was delicious and super filling.

<p>Sometimes I get takeaways. This may just look like a container of mixed vegetables but let me tell you, this is their Roast Vegetable Tart and it is divine. I tried to take it out of the container and plate it to make it look prettier but the base was falling apart.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqcKy79YytI/AAAAAAAACz8/M4-ybaQkGkM/s400/IMG_2674.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The base (which you can't see) tastes oaty and crumbly (and is apparently gluten-free for those of you needing that sort of thing) and then is topped with, actually, I don't know but it was brown and yummy. Then it's loaded up with roast veges like carrots, pumpkin, capsicum and zucchini...very delicious. Plus their chutney they serve with it is fabulous. Don't know what kind it is but I want some...now!

<p>And one can't go to </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thebluebird.co.nz/"><span><span>The Blue Bird</span></span></a><span><span> without partaking in some crumble with soy ice cream.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SOlVtQLwLZI/AAAAAAAABWk/28j6eYq6Y1Q/s400/IMG_0819.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Seriously, this crumble can completely brighten my day...like I said yesterday, it's the simple things ☺</span></span>

I normally bring lunch to work (usually leftovers...my favourite) but sometimes I've forgotten or there isn't anything to take so then I have to head further afield to find food. There aren't a great deal of good lunch options near my work unless I feel like trekking down to the foodcourt (which normally, embarrassingly enough, I normally feel too lazy).</span></span></p>

<p>Probably my favourite place to go is <a href="http://www.japaneserestaurants.co.nz/renkon.html"><span><span>Renkon</span></span></a><span><span>. I pretty much always order the same thing...</span></span></p>

Teriyaki Tofu on rice (you can't see the rice 'cause it's hidden under so much goodness). So good.

<p>If you get it takeaway you get it in one of those really cool cardboard cartons.</p>

You know those nights...you get home from work feeling super tired and super lazy and all you really want to do is curl up in bed or in front of the television and have dinner materialise in front of you. I'm sorry, but that ain't gonna happen so you'll have to go into the kitchen and whip something up pronto.</span></span></p>

<p>This is one of those meals:</p>

<span><span> <br>
It's probably just me but I thought you might be interested in what a "normal" weekday looks like for me. Every day is quite different but you get the general idea...</span></span></p>

<p>So the alarm on my phone goes off at 5:10am...welcome to Monday morning. I drag on my gym gear...laid out on the chair the night before so I don't have to use my brain. I try and drink as much water as I can manage and eat one of <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/09/fueling-up.html"><span><span>these</span></span></a><span><span>...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdpOFnnwI/AAAAAAAACxY/K7QEO6xYgq4/s400/IMG_2640.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Off to the </span></span><a href="http://www.olympicpools.co.nz/"><span><span>gym</span></span></a><span><span>! There is a queue of us completely insane people waiting outside for opening time at 5:45am. We file in, dump our gear in the lockers and head upstairs and across the bridge over the pool into the gym where I head to the peleton room and claim a bike (this is why I'm here so early...bikes go pretty fast especially as the weather improves...don't know why that is!). Spin class starts at 6:05am and is a 45 minute torture session taken by my friend L. After class I head over to the floor to finish up with some core exercises and stretches.

<p>Time to hit the showers. I only wash my hair once a week (okay, so I rinse it if it gets too icky from sport but that's it) and Monday is the day...the gym showers are great and I don't feel quite so bad about taking too long. Because I have a really sensitive scalp I use </p></span></span><a href="http://www.purist.com/product.php?product=24"><span><span>this shampoo</span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="http://www.purist.com/product.php?product=36"><span><span>this conditioner</span></span></a><span><span>. These don't make my hair as soft and silky as other products I've tried but they don't make my scalp feel like it's erupting which is rather more important!

<p>It's then off to work where I'll have breakfast at my desk. Yesterday it was a spelt muffin and fruit but sometimes I'll have toast with almond butter and jam. If I'm at home for breakfast it's normally weetbix, fruit and rice milk.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdqJWOXLI/AAAAAAAACxc/tRAn8YJOZaU/s400/IMG_2642.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>Did I really just take a photo of fruit? Not very exciting...well, as a photo anyway!</span></span></em></center><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdrK9eu1I/AAAAAAAACxg/2UXoPZf6XRU/s400/IMG_2645.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Work comes and goes but no doubt I'll spend a bit too much time having email conversations with a couple of my friends as I count down till lunchtime!

<p>Lunchtime has been leftovers lately which is awesome. When I'm cooking dinner I'll often try to make extra 'cause I don't want to have to buy lunch (for a start there aren't that many options near my office).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdsHgDQOI/AAAAAAAACxk/Df7_OZAY0oU/s400/IMG_2646.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yesterday was leftover Pumpkin and Kumara Soup from the freezer mixed with leftover veges and tofu from another night - a double-whammy of leftovers!

<p>Often Monday nights are quiet but last night I was climbing with my brother and his friend at </p></span></span><a href="http://extremeedge.co.nz/"><span><span>Extreme Edge</span></span></a><span><span>. We usually climb together about once a week but the night is always different to fit in with everyone's schedules. We are looking at doing a lead climbing course soon which is pretty much freaking me out.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVxIYItdaI/AAAAAAAACys/abyDqSqMEN0/s400/IMG_2658.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVxGwhHCsI/AAAAAAAACyo/YLi42bd8iUs/s400/IMG_2663.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>My brother really wanted his arse to feature on this blog so here it is, just for you darling bro!</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, before climbing I will normally snack on a muesli bar of some sort. Last night it was a Cool Mint Chocolate </span></span><a href="http://www.clifbar.com/"><span><span>Clif Bar</span></span></a><span><span>, my favourite.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVui6dTmsI/AAAAAAAACyc/XlWXWudPhSY/s400/IMG_2647.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>I just noticed that there is a picture of a climber on the clif bar packet...how appropriate!</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
By the time I get home I'll no doubt be exhausted as I always fail in my resolution to go to bed early on a Sunday night so very little sleep will have been had! I'll also undoubtably be hungry (if we haven't gone to get </span></span><a href="https://hellpizza.co.nz/"><span><span>Hell Pizza</span></span></a><span><span> after climbing). Last night I was too lazy to do anything so I had nut butter and jam on toast! Terrible I know but it was after 9pm when I got home and sometimes you just can't be bothered.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVuk3mETPI/AAAAAAAACyk/HGIMyiw_Qls/s400/IMG_2671.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is actually a photo of a previous breakfast but I forgot to take a photo of my dinner...but they looked exactly the same! I also discovered I had a bliss ball in the fridge from </span></span><a href="http://www.thebluebird.co.nz/"><span><span>The Blue Bird</span></span></a><span><span> so I snacked on that too. Yummy!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVuj2u00YI/AAAAAAAACyg/gB9ikWGfTxo/s400/IMG_2669.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'll then pack my bags and organise my gear and in the fridge I'll put all my breakfast and lunch food for the next day in a bag ready for me to grab as I race out the door. Then I can finally drop into bed (always aiming for 10pm but not always succeeding!) and look forward to doing it all again in the morning!

<p>Hmmmm, this seems to make my life seem somewhat boring but actually it's pretty cool (well, I think so anyway) and hopelessly busy (</p></span></span><a href="https://www.google.com/calendar"><span><span>Google Calendar</span></span></a><span><span> saves my life). I often wonder how I'm going to make it to the end of the week without dropping from exhaustion but I always do and am always ready and waiting for the week to start again come Sunday night!</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>The sun sank lower, an orange ball partially masked by the evening haze, moisture coming in from the water. Low clouds presented black faces, with silver, golden, pink, and orange highlights, and the sky was streaked with reds and golds. <br>

<span><span> <br>
My freezer supplies were getting a bit low so a bit of baking was required. One of my favourite things about baking is the way the smells fill up the whole house...always makes me smile. Anyway, first up was a loaf of country-grain bread from a bread mix. I put it in the breadmaker to knead, took it out and let rise in the loaf tin (in the gorgeous spring sunshine) and then baked it in the oven.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SmJbJYqjjaI/AAAAAAAACbY/xak8MCwuaVs/s400/IMG_2443.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Once the loaf cooled I sliced it up and put it in the freezer for breakfasts and lunches later on.

<p>I'd made the berry spelt muffins several times so I thought I'd mix things up a little and whipped up a batch of texas-sized Zucchini Spelt Muffins from </p></span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/vegan-brunch.html"><span><span>Vegan Brunch</span></span></a><span><span> (I love the taste and texture spelt flour gives to baking). I added chopped dates and walnuts for some extra oomph!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdkAZW5xI/AAAAAAAACxI/yJukaExqt7c/s400/IMG_2626.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
These are really delicious...really moist and lightly spiced. Perfect. It's actually the first time I've ever baked something with grated zucchini but it most certainly won't be the last.

<p>My flatmate has been stuck in the house looking after the puppy day after day for the last couple of weeks and was feeling a little down so I whipped up a batch of Peanut-Ginger-Sesame cookies from </p></span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/nomicon.html"><span><span>Veganomicon</span></span></a><span><span> for her (I made them gluten-free with the </span></span><a href="http://www.healtheries.co.nz/page.php?id=25&amp;prod=1127"><span><span>Healtheries Simple Baking Mix</span></span></a><span><span> as she isn't supposed to have gluten and without crystalised ginger as she's not a fan so instead I upped the amount of ground ginger to a teaspoon).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdnwEbsvI/AAAAAAAACxU/QaGqevTT5DM/s400/IMG_2635.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We had a few girl friends round that night and demolished quite a few (as well as a fair amount of dark chocolate naturally)...they are SO good!</span></span>

</div>Most mornings I am up super early for training...either running, spin class or a gym session (today, because I'm slightly crazy at times, I went to spin and then went for a training run with a friend...lucky I don't work today so I can go back to bed and have a nana nap!). Although I could never eat a proper breakfast before heading out, I certainly can't train on an empty stomach so I normally have some fruit or a muesli bar. These bars are SO good and keep me going right up until I hit the showers (and then I'm definitely ready for breakfast!).</span></span></p>

I've changed the recipe enough that it's probably okay to post it so here it is (although each time I make a batch I end up changing the ingredients a bit anyway...it's pretty forgiving):

<p>¼ cup agave nectar<br>
¼ cup molasses<br>
¼ cup rice syrup<br>
¼ cup almond butter<br>
¼ cup peanut butter<br>
⅔ cup chopped dried fruit<br>
1 tsp vanilla essence <br>
1 cup rolled oats <br>
1 cup wholegrain oats <br>
1 cup rye oats <br>
¼ cup ground flaxseed<br>
¼ cup pumpkin seeds<br>
¼ cup sesame seeds<br>
¼ cup sunflower seeds<br>
¾ cup coconut thread</p>

<p>Heat the agave nectar, molasses, rice syrup, almond butter, peanut butter and dried fruit together in a medium saucepan until the mixture starts to simmer, stirring to make sure the mixture doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.</p>

<p>Once it starts to bubble take the pan off the heat.</p>

<p>Mix in the rest of the ingredients (you might need to use your hands here to get it to mix in properly).</p>

<p>Line the base and sides of a 20cm x 20cm baking dish with baking paper and press the mixture firmly into the pan (the firmer you press it in, the better the bars will hold together).</p>

<p>Freezer the mixture in the pan for about 20 minutes and then remove and tip the set mixture onto a cutting board. Slice into bars (I find a bread knife best here). This recipe makes somewhere between 15 and 20 depending on the size you want them but don’t make them too big ‘cause they’re pretty dense!</p>

<p>Wrap each bar up individually and store either in the fridge or freezer.</p></span></span>
