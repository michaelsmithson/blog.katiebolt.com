<span><span> <br>
So while I'm off galivanting the countryside I thought I'd leave you to see a couple of cafe meals that M and I devoured the weekend before Christmas (then next time you can see my awesome tofukey I made for our family Christmas party also that weekend...it's become quite the party tradition!).</span></span></p>

<p>First up, Saturday lunch at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/cosset/128398623865596?v=wall"><span><span>Cosset</span></span></a><span><span> after a bit of ridiculously hot rock climbing. Cosset is an all vegan cafe in Mt Albert and since I was last there the food as definitely improved. First up we went for their berry smoothies in an attempt to cool down a little...I would recommend these smoothies. The best thing is that they are thick enough to eat with a spoon.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQ6OwcLWX_I/AAAAAAAAEso/e9RQ7W_gB0Q/s400/IMG_0452.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Their menu is apparently always changing...M picked the filo spiral which was filled with curried vegetables and chickpeas. I stole a bit and it was definitely delicious.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQ6Ow_JG3nI/AAAAAAAAEss/JGmjdGclf4s/s400/IMG_0455.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I decided on a piece of the filo pie...and managed to snag the last piece. Definitely a good choice. It was nice and light (filled with veggies) but filling at the same time. Pretty much perfect for a hot day.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQ6OxnBnprI/AAAAAAAAEsw/1G5xTkSnBzs/s400/IMG_0457.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We were so taken with our filo meals we have decided we have to try recreating our own.

<p>The cakes on the counter looked way too amazing to pass up on despite the fact we were going to be eating our weight in food that evening so we shared a piece of the cricket cake which was served with caramel sauce and vegan cream.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQ6OyD5vRXI/AAAAAAAAEs0/s3WGmudt6AE/s400/IMG_0458.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Oh man, this cake was amazing...a cricket cake is, apparently, a chocolate, orange and caramel cake and I think what really took it from just being another piece of cake to being something amazing was the caramel sauce as well as the soy cream.

<p>Next up was Sunday lunch at Revel on K'Rd. This cafe is definitely up there on my top cafes for their unfailingly awesome food and their super range of vegan baked goods. Anyway, I thought I'd try something new on the menu (or at least something I'd never tried before), the Tofu Satay Salad.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQ6O1lV3PCI/AAAAAAAAEtM/TaXzL2Ufxok/s400/IMG_0516.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Lots of veggies and spicy, peanuty tofu on top of a bed of salad leaves is a pretty much an ideal summer meal. I hope this stays on the menu for a while yet.

<p>Of course, we couldn't pass up on their mint slice for dessert...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQ6O2FOwwuI/AAAAAAAAEtQ/A7ZnD-MFUvU/s400/IMG_0521.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

I have a thing for peppermint chocolate so it wasn't surprising that </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/11/am-i-ever-home.html"><span><span>I fell instantly in love with Revel's mint slice</span></span></a><span><span>.

</span></span><strong><span><span>Mint Slice</span></span></strong><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Base</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
125g margarine, room temperature <br>
1 cup brown sugar <br>
1 cup flour <br>
1 tsp baking powder <br>
1/4 cup cocoa <br>
1 cup coconut thread

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Mint Filling</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
3 Tbsp margarine, room temperature <br>
3 cups icing sugar, sifted <br>
1/4-1/2 tsp peppermint essence <br>
1-2 Tbsp milk (oat, soy, rice etc)

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Chocolate topping</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
250g (1 block) Whittaker's Ghana Peppermint Chocolate (or any block of chocolate really but I only had this one on hand...) <br>
1 Tbsp margarine

<p>Preheat the oven to 180Â°C. Line a 20 x 20cm square baking tin with baking paper.</p>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Base</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Cream together the margarine and brown sugar until fluffy. Beat in the rest of the ingredients until just combined and then press into the prepared baking tin. Bake for about 15-20 minutes. Let cool.

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Mint Filling</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Beat the margarine until light and fluffy and then slowly add the icing sugar whilst beating. Add the peppermint essence and milk until you reach your desired consistency. Spread the filling over the top of the cooled base.

<p>Melt the chocolate and the margarine together and then spread gently over the mint filling. Chill until firm enough to cut into slices (about 20 pieces...).</p>

<p>Eat.</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
Well here I am, up far too late cooking black beans because I, well, didn't get on to it earlier! I also just pulled a loaf of banana bread (the one from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/veganomicon-the-ultimate-vegan-cookbook/">Veganomicon</a> if you were interested) out of the oven and am now procrastinating writing this post while I gchat with M. You see, life has been a little crazy lately. Oh fine, my life is always crazy...but I love it!!</span></span></p>

<p>So basically, it's been a couple of weeks since I got back from Christchurch but I still haven't told you about our awesome dinner at <a href="http://thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span>...because you can't really go down there and not have a fine dining experience!</span></span></p>

<p>We got a starter to share which, because I am a bit bossy, I chose...cashew cheese and crackers. The menu describes it as house cured cashew cheese served with grapes and rosemary almond flax crackers and it's raw!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiSxiN3QI/AAAAAAAAEpc/V2B_sFopXc0/s400/101118_184701.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
SO good. I just wish you got more. I loved the cashew cheese. It was so creamy and awesome! Of course, I had to get their ginger beer because it is truly awesome as well...I need some new words to describe all the awesomeness!!!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiT_ommJI/AAAAAAAAEpg/h3Ey-kGpQc8/s400/101118_185947.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For our mains we got a couple of dishes to share. I've pretty much tried everything on the vegan menu so they weren't anything new but that doesn't make them any more delicious. First up, the Portobello Magic which is portobello mushrooms served on golden brown potato rosti with wilted greens and grilled vegetables (I stole that description from the menu too!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiVMp7P5I/AAAAAAAAEpk/lBRyR8I_VbA/s400/101118_190521.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It is so ridiculously filling and delicious although perhaps a little overboard on the orange sauce. And then we had to get pizza...the veganio pizza in fact with its delicious cashew nut aioli. They clearly work magic with cashews here.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiWgqbF9I/AAAAAAAAEpo/jcxI0eOspi8/s400/101118_190528.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, I almost wished we'd got the large size so we could have taken the leftovers home. I love pizza! But you can't come all the way to The Lotus Heart and not have dessert. I mean, there is more than one vegan option on the menu! In fact, there are, like, 3 (out of 4) vegan options!!! First up, (raw) banana-nut pie with raw vegan ice cream.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiX38JsiI/AAAAAAAAEps/o7i6DoiqNIc/s400/101118_194010.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I remember ordering something of the same name here a couple of years ago and it being okay but this time it was incredible. And there is no words to describe how good this raw ice cream was. We also got a slice of vegan chocolate cake, also served with the rather incredible ice cream.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiZ_B5JrI/AAAAAAAAEpw/QWGK7oX6MSs/s400/101118_194020.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I love cake! Anyway, basically The Lotus Heart makes the most awesomest of food and I can't wait for my summer holiday and the next trip there.</span></span>

I'm now back in Auckland and the weather is as unpredicitable as ever. Earlier today it was super sunny as I wandered down the street but it's gone all grey now! I am looking forward to a summer down south.</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, here is just a little snapshot of food from the first few days down south. More to come. My flight down to Christchurch arrived just in time for me to be really starving and in need of dinner so M whipped up a mean green curry...the first of many (perhaps too many?) in a row!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TOHwj2EyLvI/AAAAAAAAEnk/JJ8n9-ffc5g/s400/IMG_0229.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I supplied the dessert...2 pieces of mint slice from Revel up in Auckland after we discovered the magic the previous weekend.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TOHwm3Let4I/AAAAAAAAEno/RFAMeY9Lzfc/s400/IMG_0232.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I now have to work out how to make my own version. This might even top the ginger crunch from Soul Food but I think I need to do a few more taste tests before I reach a final conclusion! Plus I need to do some more "sampling" research before making it myself!

<p>The next day it was a long car trip north to Nelson. We decided to go via Kaikoura where we stopped for lunch. M's sister used to work up there and suggested we try </p></span></span><a href="http://www.hislops-wholefoods.co.nz/"><span><span>Hislops Cafe</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TOHwpF6g9gI/AAAAAAAAEnw/p-GYFW4kWjM/s400/IMG_0233.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I got the lentil burger which was pretty tasty but I was really hungry so it could have done with two slices of bread instead of just the one on the bottom.

<p>After making it to Nelson just in time for our races we needed dinner so M and I ventured into town in search of </p></span></span><a href="http://www.poppythai.co.nz/"><span><span>Poppy Thai</span></span></a><span><span> after a recommendation from a local.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TOHwq9Ftr_I/AAAAAAAAEn0/-YCNtytqjA0/s400/IMG_0247.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We started off with spring rolls. I love spring rolls!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TOHwshAOiaI/AAAAAAAAEn4/pZ4_-WBn6SY/s400/IMG_0249.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I couldn't decide what I wanted for my main course until M pointed out the pineapple curry and I was sold. I added tofu to the vegetarian option and it was really delicious. Leftovers were eaten cold for lunch the next day.

<p>Nelson is pretty...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TOHxsr7blNI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/xcO8cE_GRz8/s400/IMG_0261.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...but </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Rotoiti,_Tasman"><span><span>Lake Rotoiti</span></span></a><span><span> the following day was even more amazing.

So you want to make your own ginger crunch? So you want it to be awesome? So you want it to be so gingery that it knocks your socks off?</span></span></p>

<p>We went to a potluck round the road last night and poor M had to carry steaming hot vegan lasagna fresh out of the oven. It was delicious so therefore worth his hard work.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to talking about ginger, being the awesome person that I am, I had made a super gingery ginger crunch, braving the use of the oven despite ridiculously hot temperatures (what was with that? It's back to being grey and cool today). I still think I can make a better ginger crunch (I've mainly been focused on the icing and not the base which needs some work since it's mostly just the Edmonds version) but here we go since <a href="http://wayfaringchocolate.com/"><span><span>some people</span></span></a><span><span> have been getting impatient!</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TOLne8ac7BI/AAAAAAAAEoY/oGPastori-8/s400/IMG_0334.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
</span></span><strong><span><span>Ginger Crunch</span></span></strong><span><span>*

<p>125g vegan margarine, softened (</p></span></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.olivani.co.nz/"><span><span>olivani</span></span></a><span><span> is good) <br>
1/2 cup sugar <br>
1 1/2 cups flour <br>
1 tsp baking powder <br>
2 tsp ground ginger

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Ginger Icing</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
150g vegan margarine <br>
2 Tbsp ground ginger** <br>
7 Tbsp golden syrup <br>
3 cups icing sugar <br>
crystalised ginger, chopped

<p>Cream the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy (or as long as you can be bothered especially if you only have egg beaters which are tedious). Sift the flour, baking powder and ground ginger together and mix into the creamed mixture. You might want to use your hands to get it all mixed in nicely. Press the mixture into a greased 20 x 20cm cake tin or something similar. Bake at 190C for about 20 minutes or until light brown. Just try not to overcook the edges as I did. Top with ginger icing as per below...</p>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Ginger Icing</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Melt the margarine, ground ginger, golden syrup and icing sugar together in a saucepan and mix well. Then pour over the base and sprinkle the crystalised ginger over the top (it will sort of sink into the icing). Chill until firm before cutting into pieces (a hot knife works best). I cut mine into about 20 pieces<em>*</em> but then again I was trying to feed the masses at the potluck.

<p>Eat.</p>

<p>*It's pretty hard to get this recipe wrong...let's just say I was baking in a kitchen where I couldn't find any measuring cups or scales so I improvised. It worked out fine.
<strong>Just as a note, New Zealand tablespoons (Tbsp) are 15ml whereas I think Australian ones are 20ml.
*</strong>This way you can eat several pieces without feeling bad! Not that you should feel bad anyway...ginger is good for the stomach.</p></span></span>
