I am off to Christchurch tonight. Exciting!! Anyway, while I was starting to pack the other night I thought it was ridiculous just how many pairs of shoes I had to pack for this trip (umm, 6 pairs of sports shoes including climbing and cycling shoes, a pair of jandals and some sneakers - it's a busy trip). I'd only just unpacked from going to Rotorua last weekend...some days I think I should just live out of a bag. Oh wait, I've done that before too. If you are getting the idea that I am pretty much never home then you might be right!</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, like I said, I was in Rotorua over the weekend for a <a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/2010/11/great-forest-rogaine-rotorua.html"><span><span>race</span></span></a><span><span>. M flew up on Thursday night and, after feeling too lazy to make our own breakfast we headed off to find food. I heard via the grapevine (well, you know, through an auckland vegan's </span></span><a href="http://aucklandvegan.wordpress.com/"><span><span>blog</span></span></a><span><span>) that the Vegan Revellers was back on the menu at Revel and since I remember it being delicious and I hadn't been to Revel in ages anyway I thought I'd drag M along there for breakfast.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNsqxhxlTgI/AAAAAAAAEls/lGpYzl9DKt8/s400/IMG_0143.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It is slightly different to the old version in that it has fried tofu in place of the falafel but otherwise I can't think of anything different about it. Still delicious. Still awesome. Still super filling. Yay!

<p>But we still needed dessert (yes, even at breakfast time). I sent M up to the counter to get me a slice of their peanut butter pie...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNsqyu5c39I/AAAAAAAAElw/HZs5x2rvki8/s400/IMG_0146.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...but he also came back with something else, vegan mint slice. Oh man, this was so amazing we debated going up and getting a few more pieces but since the guy serving us already thought we were crazy for eating so much sugar we decided against it but I really wish we had!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNsqz8ddw0I/AAAAAAAAEl0/DxEfI4RhaOo/s400/IMG_0147.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Unfortunately the ginger crunch at Revel (pictured in the background) isn't vegan so that was for M but I will definitely be stocking up on it when I get to Christchurch!

<p>The drive to Rotorua takes several hours so we had to stop along the way for a picnic lunch. I'd made big Blueberry Ginger Spelt Muffins from </p></span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-brunch/"><span><span>Vegan Brunch</span></span></a><span><span> but with extra crystalised ginger 'cause we both love ginger.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNsq0-2YvSI/AAAAAAAAEl8/f5a6-1C5WHw/s400/IMG_0157.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'd also made some sweetcorn and bean fritter things roughly adapted from the Edmonds sweetcorn fritter recipe (using cornflour instead of normal flour, a mixture of ground flaxseed and water instead of the normal egg, added sweet chilli sauce and a tin of cannellini beans, mashed up). I served this with a random chutney we'd bought at the supermarket and a whole lot of grapes. Much healthier than our car food!

<p>I had no idea what we were going to have for dinner so we just wandered round the supermarket in Rotorua hoping stuff would jump out at us.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNsq2Ivrt9I/AAAAAAAAEmA/BgGJtWCN7dY/s400/IMG_0168.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
In the end I cooked up some pasta with a box of </span></span><a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/products/frys-vegetarian-chicken-style-strips/"><span><span>Fry's Vegetarian Chicken Style Strips</span></span></a><span><span> ('cause it seemed amusing at the time) with some veggies and a bought pasta sauce. It was surprisingly good.</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
A few weeks ago (because I'm so organised like that) I went out to dinner with my awesome NZ brother (as opposed to the American brother 'cause going out to dinner with him might be a bit hard). I don't know that many people who are into Indian which is pretty sad so this was the perfect opportunity to hit up </span></span><a href="http://www.satya.co.nz/"><span><span>Satya</span></span></a><span><span> on </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%27Road"><span><span>K'Road</span></span></a><span><span> again 'cause I hadn't been in ages.</span></span></p>

<p>We ordered an entree to share and I'm really trying to remember what it was called but I have no idea, even after trying to decipher it from the online menu. No idea how to describe it. It was okay but a bit weird. Like...no, I have no words that fit.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0omSSKysI/AAAAAAAAEek/uCrwMxjhDu8/s400/IMG_4376.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, onto my main which I think was the Vegetable Koorma but don't quote me on that. It was really nice though. You do need to ask the waiter which items on the vegetarian menu are vegan though because only one is labelled.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0onpPU8SI/AAAAAAAAEeo/43lhaxl3wbU/s400/IMG_4377.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Along with rice, I had my koorma with a good old roti. Nothing special but really good for dipping (and making a mess everywhere).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0oo9bCCOI/AAAAAAAAEes/0YnSKeCb0gU/s400/IMG_4379.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
When we went up to pay my brother was a bit embarrassed as the guy at the desk said to us, "you're the vegan table right?"

<p>We were pretty full but I was craving chocolate sorbet despite already eating a fair bit of chocolate that afternoon (I blame the cravings on having recently gotten (got?) concussion) so we walked down into town to </p></span></span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/giapogelato"><span><span>Giapo</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0oqIsE3TI/AAAAAAAAEe0/FKRIKHFAsFE/s400/IMG_4382.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This stuff is like paradise on a spoon. Although you do have to put up with the crazy karaoke coming from inside while you eat!</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
How come it feels so good to get home again and yet it sucks at the same time? Why do some of my most favourite people have to be so far away? And why does my backlog of photos never stop growing?! Oh well! We'll get there...eventually.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXBXRBktI/AAAAAAAAEgU/ob1r2OvsJrI/s400/IMG_4450.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, you might be pleased to know that I am still in one piece. I did not fall down a 12 metre cliff and neither did I get a stick through my front wheel and come off breaking my sternum or ribs. I left those adventures to others in the team!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXDcgF15I/AAAAAAAAEgY/91wMOgc0Rcg/s400/IMG_4478.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I did, however, ride for 25 hours (that's 9 days in a row of racing and training), get some wicked cuts and bruises from crashing into rocks, fell off my bike in a bog and got completely submerged and spent more than 2 hours cleaning the mud off my bike and shoes only to find NZ customs in a relaxed mood.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXIn9ZbwI/AAAAAAAAEgo/9FNZNpbWtYc/s400/IMG_4516.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I laughed so hard that I thought I might explode, got attacked by a magpie (seriously...you can see where the beak of the bird wedged into my helmet!), lazed in the spa pool and learnt more about bikes in 9 days than I ever had in the last 3 years of riding. When I finally get a chance, there'll be more info about the trip up </span></span><a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span> if anyone is interested.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXMbVzqRI/AAAAAAAAEgw/EQr6SjPrue0/s400/IMG_4558.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Oh, and I also managed to eat some pretty good food. I didn't photograph most of it (like the awesome vegan lasagnas that got whipped up for us non-meat eaters one night) because I am a bit slack but rest assured, you will not go hungry even in small towns in Australia (I found tofu, both plain and marinated, veggie burgers, oat milk and all sorts of other staples in every supermarket I went to).

<p>This is the only photo of food that we actually cooked. This was our second night in Mt Gambia and there were three of us girls cooking together in our little unit. We were lazy and bought pre-prepared stir-fry veggies since we were traveling the next day.</p>

<p></p></span></span> <center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNQ7DudGI/AAAAAAAAEfo/uQSlwGWZ614/s400/IMG_4431.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Next stop was a farmstay not far out of Carisbrook. It had the most awesome kitchen where we would cook up communal meals each night. Down the road in Marybourgh there was a cafe (Legendz) that could make soy milkshakes. After a hot day out in the forest I couldn't think of anything better!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXE3xbtrI/AAAAAAAAEgc/W8wQzCpvsB0/s400/IMG_4488.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It was thick, cold and delicious...and I drunk it so fast that I got a headache!

<p>Food-wise, Daylseford was when it got exciting. We'd just arrived and were mulling around town whist some people were sussing out somewhere good for coffee when one of my team mates spotted a sign outside one of the cafes saying it was vegetarian and vegan.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNS7rlX6I/AAAAAAAAEfs/mKhigXafMxQ/s400/IMG_4528.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My first trip (we went twice) to the </span></span><a href="http://www.himalayabakery.com/"><span><span>Himalaya Bakery</span></span></a><span><span> I got a mini chocolate cake and organic cola.

<p>I also got an apple and cinnimon scroll to take away with me too (oh, and later on I got one to eat on the plane home too...they were big and deliciously filling).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNUqg-zII/AAAAAAAAEfw/TV0Xy4pz3XE/s400/IMG_4529.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Our first night we all went out to dinner at the </span></span><a href="http://oldhepburnhotel.com.au/"><span><span>Old Hepburn Hotel</span></span></a><span><span>. I got a veganised version of the vegetable and kidney bean nachos which was pretty good but I could have done with more bean mix and less corn chips. It didn't last all that long though (riding every day makes you hungry...and incredibly tipsy on one bottle of alcoholic ginger beer and therefore your table's entertainment for the evening)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNWrrtZZI/AAAAAAAAEf0/A52NQuiIJqw/s400/IMG_4563.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Saturday night was the social function at a pub down the road. Food was catered but I'd organised in advance for a meal to be provided for me. They ended up changing their vegetarian dish to make it vegan which I thought was pretty cool...green curry with tofu and tempeh. Not anything flash or amazing but it filled me up and, quite frankly, I was hungry so as long as it was edible I wasn't really fussed.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNYJcALtI/AAAAAAAAEf4/1BELSCXHRsI/s400/IMG_4571.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And for dessert they served me a big bowl filled with grapes and strawberries. Everyone else at my table was jealous and I had to fight them off!

<p>After our final race we went into town again for lunch and boy did I need food by then...desperately (after nearly 3 hours of mountain biking I was pretty desperate)! I managed to convince over half the team to join me at the Himalaya Bakery again! Everyone had to agree the food was really good.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNaBORMtI/AAAAAAAAEf8/l42OY8L07DU/s400/IMG_4573.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I got the open veggie burger (I think it was made from lentils). It was good. So basically, if you find yourself near </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=daylesford,+australia&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Daylesford+VIC,+Australia&amp;ei=CjzJTO-aL8-1cPmViDM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA"><span><span>Daylesford</span></span></a><span><span>, go here. I really recommend it.

<p>For our final night we went out to the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.ballarat.com/jasminethai/index.htm"><span><span>Jasmine Thai Restaurant</span></span></a><span><span> in Hepburn Springs. Items on the menu that could be veganised were clearly labelled which was super cool and my meal was delicious. Of course I was pretty forgetful that evening and forgot my camera again. Typical...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXNrm14TI/AAAAAAAAEg0/Zd7kz2nI7mo/s400/IMG_4575.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...but after over 2 hours of cleaning my bike and bike shoes (I don't think either have ever been this clean since they were brand new - look how sparkly it is!) I was completely exhausted.

<p>So all in all it was an awesome trip (and this is a ridiculously long post). Plans are already underway for next year...</p></span></span>

I go to Australia at the end of this week! I would be excited except for the fact that I'm terrified. You see, this is what happened last weekend when I was out training...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKfnHOUqvgI/AAAAAAAAEeE/NEDZX4WV918/s400/IMG_4362.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and I'd had to climb up several metres in order to take this photo! The general consensus among some of my friends is that my mountain bike has gotten jealous of my road bike and decided it would throw me off just to make sure I knew who was boss. I ended up with mild concussion and head trauma. Thanks.

<p>Anyway, we will worry about the racing when I get there and instead I will show you the delicious dinner party I had with a couple of friends the other night.</p>

<p>J made some awesome roast veggies (kumara, potato, carrot and pumpkin). You can't really go wrong there.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pdYZlYwI/AAAAAAAAEfA/UC-o4Uv89_c/s400/IMG_4343.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Our beautiful host made a big pot of vermicelli noodle stir-fry with heaps of veggies and flavoured with soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pe_CbNSI/AAAAAAAAEfE/KI8H_eGdqdc/s400/IMG_4344.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here is my plate (oh okay, my first plate 'cause let's be honest, it was really good and I was really hungry).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pglVnGcI/AAAAAAAAEfI/ylSAb6XDoHQ/s400/IMG_4345.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was in charge of dessert and after wondering what to make for ages I ended up making the </span></span><a href="http://veganzestforlife.blogspot.com/2010/09/caramel-cream-pie-oo-la-la.html"><span><span>Caramel Cream Pie</span></span></a><span><span> from Alice's </span></span><a href="http://veganzestforlife.blogspot.com/"><span><span>blog</span></span></a><span><span>. You see, I'd had a tin of this soy condensed milk and a packet of the soyatoo cream sitting around in my pantry for ages with no idea of what to do with them (does anyone else see something new and exciting and buy it without any thought of how on earth they might use it?) so this was pretty much perfect.

Next time I think I'd double the amount of caramel filling and half the amount of cream topping but otherwise it was really delicious and simple to make (which is always a bonus when you're running late after your bike gets a puncture on your training ride after you've already got lost and have been out way longer than anticipated as it is).

Looking forward to doing it all again when I get back. We already have the date scheduled!</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
The other day I told M I was a domestic goddess. That may have been a slight exaggeration but I did venture into the kitchen to do a spot of baking (and do my chores for the week). There is nothing like the smell of fresh baking wafting through the house (nothing except eating said baking). The other morning I actually woke up to the confusing smell of chocolate brownies and fresh bread as my flatmate had stayed up all night baking as an attempt to procrastinate from his study...awesome!</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, it was my Mum's birthday that night and what do all birthdays call for? Let's see...um, CAKE! This is a chocolate crumb cake. It is SO good and got much love from the family.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKP7dhDxD_I/AAAAAAAAEdY/o_pxFaenFpo/s400/IMG_4315.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here is my (first) slice. We all went back for seconds (and were all tempted by thirds but one doesn't want to overdo these things </span></span><em><span><span>too</span></span></em><span><span> much).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKP7fJgJnQI/AAAAAAAAEdg/oSHZaf9Z7ec/s400/IMG_4324.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then, because I am awesome, I whipped up a batch of chewy oatmeal-raisin cookies (from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/nomicon.html"><span><span>Veganomicon</span></span></a><span><span>) for my cousin who was chained to her desk writing her masters paper and for M who lives in Christchurch which is enough of a reason by itself but a while ago he sent me my favourite ginger crunch in the mail (for those interested, yes I will post a recipe once I get something even close to as good as this).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJ2v7WIDV2I/AAAAAAAAEcM/nD5eNdq2xB4/s400/IMG_0001.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They were really quite good and because of M you actually get a photo because I'd eaten and given away all the cookies by the time I realised I still didn't have a photo of them. Thankfully (or perhaps not but in this case it worked in my favour) the post down to Christchurch is pretty slow so he hadn't eaten all of them by the time I hounded him to take some photos. His camera is much better than mine. Perhaps I should steal it.</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
About this time last week I fell asleep at my desk but luckily today I am much more awake! 5:40am flights are not fun.</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, it feels like a lifetime ago now but about a week and a half ago now (?) I flew down to Christchurch for a race in central Otago. 10:30pm is quite possibly the latest I've ever had dinner but my plane didn't land until after 9:30pm and then we had to go pick up some gear from B's house. I think I was getting to the point of wanting to eat my hand by the time we finally got to M's house but it was okay because he had cooked me dinner!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__kG1uXAI/AAAAAAAAEVA/SMiBIKSzn74/s400/IMG_4200.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Homemade bread fresh out of the breadmaker (it was still warm!!) and pumpkin soup!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__lQ9h_oI/AAAAAAAAEVE/zDwaWr8ymN8/s400/IMG_4203.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'd made a double-batch of the Fudgy Wudgy Blueberry Brownies from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/nomicon.html"><span><span>Veganomicon</span></span></a><span><span>...one of the batches went to my brother (because I am an awesome sister!) and the other was technically for M's sister to bribe her into picking him up from the airport the week before but of course we needed to do a taste test first!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAAdEaK1cI/AAAAAAAAEVU/dQLsZ1UPk4Y/s400/IMG_4205_2.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They were so ridiculously sweet and rich that I actually only managed half a piece which is saying something since I can normally finish anything sweet! But then again, it was, like, 11:30pm by then and such a late dinner really screws with my appetite. But in saying that, they were certainly delicious and I hear via the grapevine that M's sister has polished them all off.

<p>Naturally we ended up sleeping in for ages the following morning so I was practically ravenous by the time I awoke. We had planned to go to </p></span></span><a href="http://www.theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span> for breakfast but it was shut due to minor earthquake damage so we trooped off to Cathedral Square and made it to </span></span><a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span> just in time to make their cutoff for the breakfast menu.

<p>First up...drinks. I wish I could remember what my juice was because despite being bright green it was seriously delicious. M ordered some berry smoothie...I just love the bright colours.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__mwDgutI/AAAAAAAAEVI/kwx-QwghDt4/s400/IMG_4217.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I really wanted the Flax-oat French Toast which was really delicious and super filling.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__oYgeG9I/AAAAAAAAEVM/DsxMRww_GoI/s400/IMG_4220.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
M's choice was the Raw Cacoa Crepes (at least I think that's what they were). The crepes were made with cacoa and zucchini apparently and filled with all sorts of fresh fruit.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__pzRpC0I/AAAAAAAAEVQ/G1416jC893A/s400/IMG_4223.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
On first glance I swear the crepes look like they're filled with lollies! But I'll be honest here, we both found the crepes to be far to rich and chocolatey for breakfast (I can't believe I'm saying this!). A single one of these for dessert would be amazing but it was all a bit much for breakfast.

<p>After breakfast (we'd reached midday by then!) we went for a wander around town (or the parts of it we could access) to see some of the earthquake damage. To be honest you couldn't see all that much in town because many of the roads looked like this...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAOP7b4-6I/AAAAAAAAEV0/SVCg4PcES4U/s400/IMG_4235.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There were army trucks and police cars everywhere (this was nearly a week after the first earthquake but Christchurch is still being hit by aftershocks).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAORYS20-I/AAAAAAAAEV4/1skcLenDwzE/s400/IMG_4240.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
When we parked our car to go to breakfast we passed this building below. Its whole roof had collapsed and tried to escape out the window. There are buckled buildings all over the show.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAONlprEvI/AAAAAAAAEVs/SOTQnLijFZI/s400/IMG_4208.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Each building you pass in town has a piece of paper taped to it describing it's current state. You don't want to find one of these red ones on your building.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAWg1k697I/AAAAAAAAEV8/O2GPJVzlanw/s400/IMG_4233.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We didn't head out to the south where a lot of the damage is as we were running a bit late and needing to head off on our journey into central Otago for the weekend. Thankfully I only felt a couple of aftershocks while I was in Christchurch but the low rumbling sound before the house started shaking is really quite scary.

<p>Anyway, this post is already quite long enough so the rest of the adventure will have to wait...</p></span></span>
