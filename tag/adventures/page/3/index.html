            <p></p><p>For those of you who watch Doctor Who, you probably know that the start of Season 6 is set in America. There was one Skype conversation with my brother, R about where it was filmed and he just casually mentioned that at least some of it was definitely in Utah, like the state he is living in. Then began a bit of fun looking up where each of the locations actually were (if you're interested, <a href="http://www.doctorwholocations.net/">this site is very useful</a>). I had a crazy fantasy that perhaps, when we came over, we might actually get to see them but I didn't actually imagine it was going to happen.</p>

<p>So, on the evening of our second night in Yellowstone, when R suggested a 4 day trip to Southern Utah (and Arizona) to check out each of the 4 filming locations, I was so ridiculously excited I went a little bit hyperactive! Before you get the impression that it's only me who's the Whovian in this group though, let me assure you that R and A are also big fans.</p>

<p>So there we were, on the road in search of sunshine and Doctor Who. Unfortunately the weather didn't start off so great and we had a rather wet and cold explore of Canyonlands before retreating to Moab for the night.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-12ym-6tdQus/VDYirgn44aI/AAAAAAAAF7g/_wXQAy5QfL8/s640/canyonlands.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Next morning and the real adventure begins. You don't have to drive far out of Moab before you encounter the Hole In The Rock which was a creative and pretty cool detour before onwards to our first site (and possibly the hardest because we forgot to bring any decent pictues with us to check we were in the right place), the Valley of the Gods.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gzKdU76JKJk/VDYj9Xr0YGI/AAAAAAAAF7s/H70YG-sDS44/s640/holeinrock.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The Valley of the Gods is an isolated area with huge buttes, towering pinnacles and the classic red rock desert barrenness that feels like it stretches on forever. We drove through the windy dirt road in search of site #1, pretending we were chasing down Amy with our SUV. To say it was hot would be an understatement!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-quI0Wk6Zr9c/VDYgsYRNPpI/AAAAAAAAF7U/pkOpMZBkw2s/s640/valley-of-the-gods.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Next site, the classic Western shot of Monument Valley. Easy 'cause it's right on the main road.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-NaXt7s92QH4/VDYgrcCr7_I/AAAAAAAAF7Q/zJhri6Au5d8/s640/monument-entry.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Then onwards into Monument Valley itself for our first desert campground. As a side note, it's quite hard to get your pegs to stay in properly in a desert. Got car sick on the drive round the buttes so M and I got out and ran instead. We met the others for a desert picnic as the sun went down.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-gGljG4TV5ds/VDYgrY-AkaI/AAAAAAAAF7I/LckbjBnzLZc/s640/monument-valley-01.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Nice morning for a run round a mitten right?</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-456_pVfdf3I/VDYgrfWx6CI/AAAAAAAAF7E/McGtfJE57mg/s640/monument-valley-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Site #3, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glen_Canyon_Dam">Glen Canyon Dam</a> in Arizona, is not something you could miss. It's really quite huge. R even organised us all a tour of the dam. It's super high security so we had to go through metal detectors and empty our pockets and all that to be let through but you do get to stand on the dam itself (and check out some of the inner workings lower down - very worth it).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ArR69n0MOOc/VDYpEDdh9mI/AAAAAAAAF8I/st56gogROLk/s600/glencanyondamn.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Quick trip to the Horseshoe Bend...</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-QUWbiz8KNDU/VDYs9wCAlXI/AAAAAAAAF8c/nEuu78Lhq0U/s640/horseshoe.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>...then it was on to the 4th and final site, Lone Rock Beach, Lake Powell - or, as we knew it, Lake Silenceo. This place is amazing. It's hard to get your head around the fact you are camping on a beach, in the sand, but you are actually at the edge of a large canyon in the desert that's been turned into a lake by the dam. It's beautiful.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/--A9o1Tmz3Fs/VDYs-g_4qUI/AAAAAAAAF8k/TCLGgNgOkEM/s640/silenceo-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Our drive back to Salt Lake City was along the beautiful Cottonwood Canyon Road before the storm rolled back in. I think on this trip I fell in love with the red deserts. We have nothing even close to this kind of thing at home and to me it looks and feels like another world. I still can't believe it's real. America is amazing!</p>

            <p></p><p>Jeepers, it's October already and I haven't posted any more of our USA adventures. Too busy with adventures back home (and getting sick...sigh).</p>

<p>Right, well let's get going shall we?</p>

<p>After the <a href="../../../../mountain-lions-and-fallen-logs/">rogaine</a>, my brother (R) and his wife (A) took us on a pretty awesome road trip. Firstly we headed over to the Badlands 'cause who doesn't want to see an alien landscape and bask in the intense heat of the desert right?</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-496Kc01h9Sw/VCzaffotIjI/AAAAAAAAF3g/J5dYM-kM-Ew/s640/badlands-01.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-OkMkXSzCp5I/VCzd-m4lcDI/AAAAAAAAF4M/3kClYZJEkoo/s640/badlands-03.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>As an added bonus we got to test out our new tent for the first time (the <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/big-agnes-fly-creek-tent-ul2-2-person-3-season?ti=U2VhcmNoIFJlc3VsdHM6YmlnIGFnbnVzIGZseSBjcmVlazoxOjY6YmlnIGFnbnVzIGZseSBjcmVlaw&amp;skid=BAG000W-SIL-ONESIZ">Big Angus Fly Creek UL2</a> - nice and lightweight for upcoming cycling adventures but, umm, pretty thin!).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-6lSKwawgYRA/VCzXRdWBNiI/AAAAAAAAF3M/Bq8Tq5ci010/s640/140818_194622.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Oh, and see some pretty cool animals. Big horn sheep are definitely more exciting and scary looking than the sheep we have at home!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-g5nHi9h3fuo/VCzaftYRQaI/AAAAAAAAF3k/Zd7VEPeheCU/s500/badlands-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>We also got some brilliant views of the night sky. I was amused during the astromoner talk that night when they were asking us what the most well known constallation in the night sky was. Ummm, the Southern Cross right? Oops, wrong hemisphere!</p>

<p>How about a trip to the Devil's Tower next? You can laze in a hammock too (until you get told to take it down). First time in a hammock too. Awesome. We've been missing out for so long!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-s8tBZ9hbrUU/VCzgBHOnKKI/AAAAAAAAF48/QWDouniattI/s640/devils-tower.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Then it's onto more driving, and into the rain too just to make it a little bit more exciting (and a lot colder...to make sure that I get to use all of the far too many clothes that I brought on this trip). A nice wet, dark arrival in Yellowstone is the perfect time to practice putting up your tent with the fly first. Thankfully there are no photos of me crawling around underneath setting it up!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_pSDwdlbQU8/VCzhZ5vZc2I/AAAAAAAAF6E/apbFdXL2G0w/s640/140821_130159.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Morning dawns a mixture of rain and delicious icy coldness (possibly sarcasm but one can never be sure) which means it is the perfect day to go animal spotting, geyser wandering, exploring and picnic just as darkness and the storm approached.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-ypvEIBOSUvE/VCzlihuSBPI/AAAAAAAAF6c/JQrQW17NWOY/s640/yellowstone.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Oh yeah, and go run up a little hill to get a better view of the Grand Prismatic Spring (then bush bash down the other side of course).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/--5Mn5QDtBTE/VCziUL5lUEI/AAAAAAAAF6M/cwzinfR9Wgk/s640/grand-prismatic-springs.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The weather showed no real signs of abating (despite small patches of sunshine) so after another night in Yellowstone we drove through The Grand Tetons...</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-_3Yf-WInbUg/VCzgSCzmP1I/AAAAAAAAF5Q/dSJNYVUuzOg/s640/140822_120143.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>...and onwards towards the Doctor.</p>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>In which L and I see a mountain lion and stumble over far too many fallen trees.</p>

<p>So the "main" purpose of our trip to the States was for me to compete in the World Rogaine Champs in the Black Hills of South Dakota (in other words, a good excuse to visit my eldest brother and his wife who live in Salt Lake City!). Plus the furthest afield I'd ever been up until this point had been bashing around in the bush somewhere in Australia so it was probably about time I headed off overseas somewhere like everyone else seems to do.</p>

<p>This is not the first time I've competed in the World Rogaine Champs. My first time was in <a href="../../../../world_rogaine_champs_cheviot/">Cheviot in 2010</a> a few years back. But this time was a rather more serious approach as L is amazing and we had the potential, if we had a good race, to make it onto the podium. Yeah, just a little bit of pressure. Mostly though we just wanted to do the best that we could (and not get eaten by a mountain lion or bitten by a rattlesnake). I hadn't had the best build up to this race either with a foot injury earlier in the year meaning I had to do a lot of cycle training instead.</p>

<p>The day before the race was supposed to be relaxing but ended up being stressful with M having to take the place of one of the other guys in the Open Men's team at the last minute. We'd both not had the best sleep that week either which was starting to worry me. In the afternoon my brother and his wife arrived which helped keep my mind off the following day a bit though.</p>

<p>Race morning and I'm not sure if many of us managed to stomach breakfast all too well. I was so nervous (and worried about M...silly me!). We arrived at the event with lots of time and managed to find a space at a table in the big tent next to some Aussie teams (3 of the 4 were actually ex Kiwis!) and nervously awaited map handout. Once we got our maps though it was all go. It didn't take us too long to plan our route as there seemed to us to be a clear part of the map that we wanted to be once it got dark (the north east corner) so we planned our (highly optimistic) route around this.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-bAgEp9AkTcw/VB_pGq3I_3I/AAAAAAAAF0U/HjW_36Efij4/s640/rogaine-before.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">L and I pre race. Yep, the map is huge but bear in mind we'd already cut it down a bit too. Good for hiding under in case of rain right?</p>

<p>About 11:45am we were all ushered into the start area for an anxious 15 minute wait until the gun went off. It looked like there were a large amount of teams heading to the same first control as us (#25) so we set off fairly fast in order to not get held up in a queue. Seemed pretty successful. What always amazes me is how quickly teams spread out and how, despite there being something like 500 other people out there, we were mostly by ourselves by the 3rd control.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-nK-RD_7W3UQ/VB_pP-3cO-I/AAAAAAAAF0c/UZVPOzQmbig/s640/_DSF0161.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">And we're off...the line of runners heading off to control #25. It's somewhere up in the bush there.</p>

<p>It all started out so well for the first hour but then the heat started to get to me and I found I couldn't seem to keep down any food other than chomps. Fortunately I was still able to drink so I wasn't getting dehydrated but I was losing energy fast. We tried sitting down for a couple of minutes at a time in order to help get food down but it wasn't working. Heat and incredibly rough terrain was not helping  but I'm pretty stubborn when I want to be so there was no way I was giving up. We made it to the first water stop around 6:30pm, later than we'd wanted (although the terrain was turning out to be even rougher than the model map had been which seemed almost impossible!). There were people there to greet us and a note pasted on to the water barrel from L's partner and I think you could have actually seen our spirits lift at the sight of a friendly face. I managed to get down a gel and a few of L's corn chips and then we were off.</p>

<p>Darkness hit around 8:30pm (we had just made it to #74, determined to get there before requiring headlights) and we were faced with our first night control (#64), an incredibly vague spur in the middle of thick bush. Nailing that was an incredible boost for the spirits. We were heading back out through the bush after that control when L suddenly stopped and bent down to pick up a stick, telling me that I ought to do the same. It was then that I saw the eyes watching us from under a fallen tree. Not too far from where we were standing I could make out the shape of what could only be a mountain lion, pretty much my biggest fear for this whole trip. We started making as much noise as we could and had our whistles at the ready whilst slowly trying to make our way back out to the track. The eyes kept watching us the whole way. It was only once we'd gotten back out onto the track that, after checking we could no longer see it, we started running, turning round every now and then just to double check. We nearly scared ourselves to death at the sight of a deer and the way our headlights lit up the reflectors on the track posts.</p>

<p>After a rather long stretch of not getting any controls (not that I suspect we could have navigated all that successfully to them anyway as it took a long time for the panic to die down!) we were back into the bush for some more vague controls to test our night navigation! Finally, around midnight, we made it to #41 and the easier navigation. Oh, and our friends G&amp;T who were also not having the best of races. We headed round the next few controls together which boosted everyone's moral before leaving them to go our own way. By this stage I could stomach a little bit more food (mostly just tofu and a few crackers so not ideal but better than nothing) so I was feeling a bit more on the planet.</p>

<p>Some time not long after 6am though we both had managed to develop incredibly sore feet. I've had sore feet in these events before but nothing like this. A change of socks, more vaseline and some pain killers brought about a small amount of relief but still, at times we were reduced to a hobble! I think in the last couple of hours we could have been a lot more aggressive but we just couldn't handle the foot pain and had decided that as long as we finished after 11:30am then that would just have to be enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-O81aAXGHHOI/VB_pSC3yflI/AAAAAAAAF0o/KqK_oHuFci4/s640/_DSF0193.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">L and I at the finish.</p>

<p>I can't tell you how relieved I was to finish, take my shoes off and sit down...24 hour rogaines are such painful things. Why do we do them?! But even better was seeing my brother and M at the finish line cheering us on.</p>

<p>This event was by far the toughest terrain I've ever been in (just the continuous battle through endless fallen trees for hours on end) but despite the pain and exhaustion it was actually really fun. We both agreed it was an excellent course (if not the greatest of maps) and we can now add mountain lion to the list of animals seen (although I think I would have preferred not to have seen one!). I definitely learnt some lessons and I have a long way to go in terms of figuring out a fail-safe food plan...sigh.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-92CSuKogEkI/VB_pSVkM4xI/AAAAAAAAF0s/W-CON4mGWJk/s640/_DSF0209.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">Yep, I sure was happy to be finished. I almost look fresh in this photo but I sure didn't feel that way!</p>

<p>There should have been a prize giving within an hour of everyone finishing but somehow there was a rather large technical disaster with the results and so we had to wait about 2 weeks for the results to be announced. So much anticipation! Somehow, despite having a pretty rough race, L and I managed to take second place in the Women's Open grade. My medal arrived in the post a few days ago but it all feels rather surreal without having a prize giving.</p>

<p><em>Thanks to my awesome brother R for the photos!</em></p>

            <p></p><p>Yep, we're finally back in the land of the long white cloud. Well, actually we've been back for just over a week now but my head is still all over the place.</p>

<p>I have returned with more vegan cheese than I can possibly cope with (well, only 3 packets but to be honest I'm over it all ready...I definitely prefer the european vegan cheese sorry!) and chocolate-covered pretzels! The guys in bio-security at Christchurch Airport weren't too worried about that but they did have a laugh at just how many pairs of sports shoes I kept pulling out of my bag. I feel like we bought the entirety of <a href="http://www.rei.com/">REI</a> and <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/">Backcountry</a> home with us!</p>

<p>Anyway, I have much excitement to tell - from encountering a mountain lion in the dark to exploring Southern Utah in search of Doctor Who - but right now I need to go to bed so you'll have to wait to hear those stories.</p>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>One of the things I love most about rogaines is the scenery. You get to go to places you would never normally be able to see (as the land is privately owned or you are well off the beaten track - busy thrashing through matagouri or climbing up through the tussock).</p>

<p>But there is always at least one moment where you wonder what on earth you are doing out there and you wish it could just end. Last weekend that moment came as we were clambering up the steep, rocky slopes of Mt Trotter. The tussock was so high I couldn’t see my team mate and was hiding the dreaded <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aciphylla_colensoi">spaniard</a>, so I’d grab hold of some tussock to haul myself up with and find I’d managed to stab myself with the sharp points of the spaniard. It was worth it for the magnificent views and the 100 points we gained at the top though.</p>

<p>With no Heights of Winter last month I was definitely starting to feel anxious about not getting in a decent length race with my World Rogaine Champs teammate, L. We've done several short rogaines together (including a fun 3 hour one at Vic Park a couple of weekends back) and been in the same team for TWALK this year but a long rogaine is different. L is very fast and, as one of my friends says, an energizer bunny as well as being an excellent navigator. I was definitely getting anxious I wasn’t good enough to be her team mate.</p>

<p>Anyway, this past weekend we finally had a chance to race together at the Golden Road rogaine in Otago (in what was going to be a 13hr race but was cut down to 11 hours for various reasons).</p>

<p>A few of us drove down the night before and camped at the event centre (after a freezing weekend camping at Lindis Valley for a previous rogaine in April we all brought way too much gear for what turned out to be a fairly mild couple of nights!) so I picked up the map early and started planning our route...which turned out to be easier than normal - really just a matter of creating loops and working out which one to head out on first. So by the time L arrived I had a route all planned out (and fortunately she agreed with it!).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-67t7_4HPB6A/U8j7NElzUOI/AAAAAAAAFvM/vH1kiV9P03A/s640/golden-road-rogaine.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>It was a pretty cold morning and we had a river crossing within a couple of minutes of starting (and then another one not long after that) so I think we were both glad to get to the first hill to start the warming up process. People were heading off all over the place and it only looked like a couple of other teams were heading out our way but they were a long way behind. This was pretty much the theme of the day as we hardly saw anyone out there and when we did they were going the opposite direction. It was like having the hills all to ourselves. Rogaines are funny like that. There could be hundreds of you out there but quite often you spend long periods of time seeing no one. Also, as usual, the scenery was spectacular. We didn't have a camera on us but there are some photos (and race reports) on <a href="http://tanecambridge.wordpress.com/2014/07/14/golden-road-rogaine/">Tane's blog</a> and <a href="http://runlongergeek.wordpress.com/2014/07/15/golden-road-rogaine/">Matt Bixley's blog</a> (complete with a photo of the awesome stone yards L and I got excited over).</p>

<p>We kept a pretty steady, quite fast (for me anyway, especially as I'd had a cold all week and was lacking that last bit of energy) pace, working as a team on our navigation. There was possibly a bit of a lack of focus (too much gossiping!) in the first hour but we got into a good flow. At just under 6 hours in we'd completed our first 2 loops so which meant we had time to head out the back to the far east of the map.</p>

<p>From #60 we ended up going to #42 first then #24 (the climb back up to this was tough going by this stage though) and in retrospect we should have left one of them out but we still thought we had time to finish with the #72 &gt; #48 &gt; #92 but by the time we actually got out to the road it was dark and we had 1 ¼ hours to go so it seemed too risky (if it had been daylight I think we'd have gone for it though) so we decided to abandon #72 and head straight to #48. We managed to screw up #48 and got ourselves into a panic (the first control in the dark is always entertaining!). Then it was an exhausting slog to the 90 pointer and down to #26 where we looked at our watches and saw we had about 15 minutes to go. We both joked that we'd get in trouble if we got back that early so we decided to risk another 10 points with #11. There was precious little time to get back to the finish after that so it was a mad dash down the hill to the woolshed where we got thwarted by all the stockyard gates! We must have clambered over at least 10 in our hurry! Made it with probably no seconds to spare!</p>

<p>All in all it was a great day and I am definitely feeling more confident about surviving the Worlds with L. We seemed to work well as a team and, most of the time, I didn't even feel too slow! Starting to get a little bit excited...2 ½ weeks until we leave!</p>

            <p></p><p>Last weekend was supposed to be Heights of Winter, a 12 hour rogaine that happens every year in Canterbury around the full moon during June, but this year it was cancelled for, quite possibly, the first time after major flooding in North Canterbury earlier in the week. It's been a pretty wet year so far in Canterbury with with several floods in our street already and the hills are pretty green (they've been pretty brown for pretty much the whole time I've been here).</p>

<p>Anyway, we'd already booked a couple of baches in Gore Bay for the event so it seemed a shame not to head up there for the weekend anyway especially since the forecast was so spectacular.</p>

<p>Saturday a small group of us headed over to Kaikoura and up Mt Fyffe while the others did some other more epic icy mission. My favourite thing is going up steep hills so the track up to the hut was awesome (about 1100m). After that, however, the track started to get pretty icy and I ended up slipping over and hitting my head so M and I headed back down (and then up to the hutt again because hills are fun!) whilst the others continued. Spectacular views from the top and it wasn't even too cold!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-tbRG92zPeH4/U6QCgYDKyUI/AAAAAAAAFp8/-Y8Q9lSbBWE/s640/mt-fyffe.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>In the evening there was the most amazing full moon which I wished I'd taken a photo of. My friend C and I had a very lovely walk by moonlight along the beach. It was so beautiful and the sound of the waves crashing against the shore is like soothing music.</p>

<p>Sunday, after a lot sleep in (!), a group of us biked over the hills to the Hurunui River and back (with a few detours down to the coast). It was a perfect cycling day - not too cold and very calm.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Xbdbg6Rg2xA/U6QChSHtllI/AAAAAAAAFqE/3CyXm1fiCIs/s500/hurunui.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>So all in all it was a pretty good weekend but still pretty sad there was no Heights of Winter this year especially since I could do with the training. We are heading to the States in about a month and a half for the World Rogaine Champs in South Dakota and I have yet to race a long rogaine with my team mate (other than TWALK and I'm not sure that really counts)! Hopefully the Golden Road Rogaine takes place next month. M has been helping me work on my route planning which is definitely helping.</p>

<p>But I better get ready for bed. Tomorrow is the shortest day here and we are planning on riding from sunrise to sunset (or something like that). Should be fun!</p>
