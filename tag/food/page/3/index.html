- <em>Dead Reckoning</em> by Charlaine Harris</span></p>

<p>So how did I spend the first part of my "summer" holiday (which feels like a lifetime ago now)? Well last Christmas M and I went <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.co.nz/2011/01/paddling-for-food.html">kayaking in the Queen Charlotte Sound</a> which was amazing so this year a group of us decided we were going to kayak in the neighbouring sound, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pelorus_Sound">Pelorus Sound</a>. The 4-day trip turned into a 5-day trip when the weather went from wet to wild and we were trapped (we did attempt to paddle back but it became apparent there was no way that was going to happen). The days were long and hard and I ended up very sick by the morning of the fourth day. It was quite an experience!</p>

<em>Food...food is good. Over half the party was vegetarian or vegan so we all cooked together. When you're kayaking you can take heaps of stuff so we had tinned beans, heaps of fresh vegetables, wraps, tofu, pasta, wraps, rice...epic amounts of food. Turned out to be fortunate as we couldn't get back in on the last day and had to stay out an extra night.</em></p>

<em>So the boys decided we were going to portage (meaning carry the kayaks) over the bank. You can see that it wasn't exactly flat. In fact on the other side it was more of a sheer drop!</em></p>

<p>Oh man, it’s been a LONG time. So long that I can’t even remember everything that’s happened! I was trying to go through all my photos and it all got a bit much! I can’t believe it’s already two thirds of the way through February. Where is the year going?</p>

<p>I know it was months ago but the easiest place to start seems to be Christmasy stuff. Christmas time basically involves lots more cooking, baking, eating, socialising and all that kind of stuff.</p>

<p>The weekend before Christmas M and I travelled up to Auckland for the annual family get together. To start with we proceeded to eat our way around some of my favourite places in Auckland (as well as catching up with some of our favourite people) including lunching at <a href="http://www.cosset.co.nz/">Cosset</a>...</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EbNwczKuKg4/T0C22Jdm7qI/AAAAAAAAFPo/fyLKT8OtQFE/s640/Cosset.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
No, I didn't eat ALL of that! But what I did eat was delicious!

<p>We then had to devour lots of food at the family Christmas party that evening. I'd made my <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.co.nz/2011/01/dreaded-tofudabeast.html">tofukey</a> which always goes down well. It's nights like this that make me miss being back up in Auckland with my family. My aunts and uncles are like second parents and my cousins have become brothers and sisters.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jOPuggH4eXk/T0C2234cgvI/AAAAAAAAFPw/pg72ceRoyZc/s640/Family%2520Xmas.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Pancakes for brunch at Revel were the perfect way to recover from the food coma of the night before (okay, that's not strictly true but it seemed like an awesome idea at the time). They were buckwheat pancakes served with rhubarb...delicious.

<p>Christmas eve was all about singing carols in the park whilst trying to keep the candle from blowing out (which we failed at miserably!).</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-4qev9NYpRW0/T0C3Aqhm4eI/AAAAAAAAFQI/yF4zQ6xqehI/s400/111224_211207.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Christmas itself was spent at M’s family’s house where we got to eat potatoes that were dug from the garden right before our very eyes and I ate peas straight from the pod (11 peas in one pod - apparently that's good luck).

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-sJczRwpFZYs/T0C24IHIBLI/AAAAAAAAFP4/H-K3Dv7Nd74/s640/Xmas01.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
I made tofukey and Christmas pudding (which was served with soy cream and fresh berries) for everyone. I love Christmas food. Christmas cake was also made...I think I might need to make another one now so we can enjoy it at all times of the year.

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-u3sajam8_0w/T0C25FOUjCI/AAAAAAAAFQA/xYAscgLXwdM/s640/Xmas02.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
All in all I think it was quite possibly the best Christmas I've ever had. Yay!

<p>Join me next time when I dive back down into the deep archives of time since my last post and find some other exciting things to tell you about! I promise it won't be far away.</p>

- <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen</span></p>

<p>Hello! We're busy playing the 'guess how big that aftershock was' game after a rather large shake (it knocked a few things out of our pantry so it's got to be at least a 5. Extra points for guessing where it was centred. You might laugh but some people had bets on one at work once!).</p>

<p>M and I have spent most of the day in a food coma after eating up large at the <a href="http://www.vegetarianexpo.org.nz/">vegetarian expo</a> and then eating lots of cake and bread at his parents' house (his Mum made this vegan orange cake especially for us. I think I'm going to have to get the recipe off her because it was delicious). I have to say though, a food coma is a bit more pleasant than the total exhaustion state we were both in last night after a rogaine based out of <a href="http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=castle+hill+village,+canterbury&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-43.206177,171.728668&amp;spn=0.670659,1.601257&amp;sll=-41.244772,172.617188&amp;sspn=43.960078,68.994141&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;hnear=Castle+Hill,+Canterbury&amp;t=h&amp;z=10">Castle Hill</a> (it was crazy - we started in a snowfall and finished in beautiful sunshine a few hours later!).</p>

<p>First up, before we even got inside, we got vegetarian sausages with all the trimmings (mustard, sweet chilli sauce, onions and tomato sauce). I devoured mine in no time because I was starving (only having an apple for breakfast will do that for you...but I was determined to eat far too much at the expo so had to make sure there was going to be room). I think the sausages they used were the <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/">Frys</a> ones. Later, inside the expo, I had a good chat to the people from Frys about their <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/products/frys-vegetarian/introducing-4-new-products/">new products</a> which are coming soon and I got all excited!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WTYi33zIDtQ/TpFhzK_bkKI/AAAAAAAAFNs/-jYpgLzd7iI/s640/food01.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Next up I got all excited by these tiny little cupcakes and the vegan society stall so I had to get one of the lemon ones. It was eaten in no time (you could have eaten the whole thing in one go but I tried to make it last a bit longer).

<p>I then downed a shot glass of vegan beer from the <a href="http://casselsbrewery.co.nz/">Cassels &amp; Sons Brewery</a>. Now that was quite nice and I might have to pop out there and get some but it was a bit early for me and alcohol to meet (11am). I think I got a whole lot more giggly after that.</p>

<p>Then it was time for some serious browsing of the stalls (while I giggled continuously and got all excited at the smallest of things). This didn't last all that long because I stumbled across another stall selling the most amazing looking vegan baking. <a href="http://www.catrescue.org.nz/">Cat Rescue Christchurch</a> had a big table filled with delicious-looking home baking but my eye was instantly caught by the ginger crunch so I had to have some of that.</p>

<p>After the mini sugar coma I was now in we decided something savoury was in order. We'd thought about pies but ended up going for samosas with chutney from, well I can't remember where from but they were delicious and very spicy.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8Ykh_XlfETM/TpFhz809jAI/AAAAAAAAFNw/hmP1Fcv_I8s/s640/food02.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Drink was definitely required after that but when we wandered over to The Lotus Heart stall I got carried away and ended up getting a slice of raw lemon cheesecake instead!! It was divine. They have got this whole raw dessert thing down to a T (or is it a little t? I've never written that phrase down before). Luckily M was a bit more sensible and bought us some sparkling orange and ginger drink to share.

<p>You'd think we'd be full by now but the pies were still calling. We ended up getting a Country Pie to share from the <a href="http://www.lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/">Linda McCartney Foods</a> stall. The pastry was delicious but the filling was slightly too 'meaty' for my taste. M seemed to like it though.</p>

<p>Then just to top it off, I'd come to the realisation I hadn't gotten anything chocolaty yet so I headed back to the lovely ladies at <a href="http://www.catrescue.org.nz/">Cat Rescue Christchurch</a>. I don't know who you ladies are but you do amazing work and are incredible bakers. When we have somewhere where I can have a cat I am totally heading your way. Anyway, I picked up a slice of peppermint chocolate cake which I picked at once we got home (it was incredible).</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pQQ0QMPZfZU/TpFhSaM8TCI/AAAAAAAAFNo/grZOVaeIJlE/s640/food03.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
So yeah, basically the vegetarian expo was awesome and I'm most grateful for the lady at work who told me about it. As you can probably guess by this post (and like I said on the feedback form afterwards), I was pretty much just there for the food and it did not disappoint.

<p>By the way, for those who were curious, the official quake magnitude is now up and it was a 5.5. Exciting!</p>

<p>After far too many late nights this past weekend (yes, I am a nana and proud of it) I am so tired that all I really want to do is curl up on the couch while watching episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jonathan_Creek_episodes">Jonathan Creek</a>. I've only seen 3 episodes so far but along with his lying on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007mf4f">The Unbelievable Truth</a> (he talked about tigers AND managed to smuggle all 5 truths past everyone so he earns extreme points for that alone) I am becoming an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Davies">Alan Davies</a> fan. I get a bit obsessed about things. This might turn out to be one of them.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4TBGhJR6mQk/TmSe-Y1UW2I/AAAAAAAAFNY/e4Olt4_vu4Q/s400/IMG_2140.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Random photo of a rock to distract you momentarily. Note how they felt that you required a cone to point the rock out in case you missed it. They've gone a bit cone crazy here I think.</em></center> <br>
Right, well today I thought I would tell you about pie. Pie in New Zealand would pretty much automatically mean a meat pie of some kind for most people. I remember when I was a kid my Mum would occasionally buy a supermarket 'family' pie and attempt to cut it into 5 pieces. There would be much argument over who got what bit because the pie was, rather unfortunately, a rectangle and if you got one of the end pieces you basically only got pastry (although this wasn't too bad since that was the only real bit I liked on them).

<p>Anyway (that was quite a tangent...got a bit nostalgic there!), fast-forward to today (or, in reality, a few weeks ago) and I thought I might try my hand at making my very own pie. I've never made a pie before and I'd bought myself a pie dish after getting all excited and buying everything in sight back when we were setting up our flat. This pie is nothing like the pie of my childhood. In fact, it's nothing like any pie I'd ever had before but it was darn tasty. It's a bit of an adaption on the Mushroom, Leek and White Bean Pie from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-brunch/">Vegan Brunch</a> with my first ever batch of homemade pastry.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sfkx6Wf5Y3U/Tkitc604sQI/AAAAAAAAFKc/8EKLH_eJ7ak/s400/IMG_2372.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
I didn't have enough mushrooms (or the kind of mushroom it talks about since I've never heard of cremini mushrooms before but fortunately white button mushrooms worked just fine) so I added heaps of onion. It seemed to all work out. But what couldn't when it was encased in rich, melt-in-your-mouth pastry (I think I might have overdosed on the margarine!)? I know the recipe says to leave it at least 30 minutes before serving and that it's best at room temperature but honestly, I thought it was way better hot out of the oven (or hot after being heated up in the oven again) and with a whole lot of my Mum's feijoa and ginger chutney.

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WYMzqVjkfa8/Tkite3yAwbI/AAAAAAAAFKo/cFfXMe7YvdA/s400/IMG_2381.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
So, I've done the savory pie but it appears that most of the world are used to associating pies with sweet desserts. M's Mum gave us the most ginormous of pumpkins and I was pretty much over eating pumpkin soup and putting it in every meal we had so I thought, since we were heading off to a pot luck, that I'd attempt to make pumpkin pie. I've never had it before (apart from a <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/08/its-all-very-exciting.html">raw version at The Lotus Heart</a>) and decided I'd use the Pump-Can Pie recipe from Kris' <a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/cookbook/">100 Best Vegan Bak­ing Recipes</a>.

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TKAO3dwjQik/TmScIAJ0sLI/AAAAAAAAFNQ/WI7uR-VRMRc/s400/IMG_2500.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
It seemed to work out okay although I should have actually used the amount of sugar the recipe called for rather than naively thinking it would be too much. It sort of tasted a bit weird but then again, the idea of pumpkin pie seems a bit odd to me. I think I'd rather make it with kumara (which my Dad thought was even more of an odd idea). People did seem to enjoy eating it though, even my friend's little girl who hated the pumpkin in the savoury dish. She ate all her pie but didn't even finish her ice cream!

<p>The last pie, however, is definitely awesome. <a href="http://likeavegan.com.au/2010/09/caramel-cream-pie/">Caramel Cream Pie</a>...with a name like that you can't really go wrong! I have made a variant of it before (using tofu instead of soy cream cheese which is actually probably the best way to go to be honest because then it isn't so mind-blowingly rich) but this time I thought I'd go all the way and see just how many fake dairy products I could use!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6y_H_fTJajc/TmScIpaqOvI/AAAAAAAAFNU/siK8HhpIr_0/s400/IMG_2508.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
This pie lasted ages because you could only eat fairly small slivers at a time before feeling ill and like you might need a lie down after the explosion of sweet, rich, fake dairy goodness. Make it now but be prepared for the coma you might find yourself in afterwards!

<p>Right, sorry about all that rambling. I'm tired and my brain is spinning around and drifting off a bit. But go and make some pie. That will make everything better!</p>

- <em>Dead Reckoning</em> by Charlaine Harris</span></p>

<p>Right now I am buried deep in boxes after the truck came and dropped off all my stuff from Auckland. SO exciting! I am impatiently waiting for M to find something to prop the front of my bookcase up on (the floor is uneven) so I can unpack all my books. Impatient might be an understatement...</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-frWGDlem1UA/Thjmpl_AgcI/AAAAAAAAFIA/Mx1y6qcRmbA/s400/IMG_2102.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, a couple of weekends ago we invited M’s parents and sister round for dinner which was an awesome excuse to get my hands dirty doing some fun cooking. I really wanted to make bread from scratch which is something I haven’t really done before (apart from making pita bread once which is pretty fun). I had a recipe from my old flatmate which I was keen to try out so on Saturday afternoon I found myself elbow deep in flour! But it was all worth it because the bread came out divine.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qUb_c020p5c/ThjmraPPocI/AAAAAAAAFIE/mUx9DgagEeQ/s400/IMG_2103.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also really wanted to make corn chowder so I had a array of different ingredients I thought might possibly go in it but no real idea of what I was going to do. This seems to be a common theme of my cooking! I had browsed various recipes but nothing was quite what I wanted so I just made it up as I went along. There is onion, pumpkin, potato, celery, corn, coconut cream, veggie stock, sundried tomatoes, various spices among various other ingredients I can’t remember now. It all seemed too chunky for my liking once it was done though so I bizzed it up a tiny bit with the stick blender so there were still plenty of lumps but nothing too ginormous.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ADIW9kiSIbA/ThjmtKgVLDI/AAAAAAAAFII/k3NZbXm_kv8/s400/IMG_2104.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It ended up turning out delicious and served with the bread I was quite impressed with myself! We ended up eating way too much and getting super full...always a sign of a successful meal. But of course you have to have dessert. I had a whole lot of rhubarb in our freezer which M’s Mum had given us so I stewed that up with some apples and raisins and made a delicious crumble. So all in all it was the perfect winter feast.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SgB8Gc8XhW8/ThjmuedM0CI/AAAAAAAAFIM/1kKjMfbNG3Q/s400/IMG_2109.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Since then it’s got steadily colder. In fact they reckon there might be snow down to sea level tomorrow...I hope they are wrong! But now I have all my books so I guess it could be worse!</span></span>

- </span></span><em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Sophie’s World</span></span></em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> by Jostein Gaarder</span>
<span> <br>
M and I moved house last weekend so now we have somewhere of our own which is terribly exciting. I mean, I have a fancy big fridge all to us and a kitchen that I can arrange any way that I like! And, at last, my cooking inspiration is slowly starting to come back again after what feels like forever (months? Years even?).</span></span></p>

<p>But our first meal at the new place was Hell pizza on the only furniture we’d moved at that stage...a table with a couple of chairs! I like to customise the Sinister pizza (which is naturally vegan but mixing the toppings up a little is always fun) and if you get the big one then you have leftovers for the following night when you’re too tired from moving to even contemplate cooking something proper.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-Wr4V639eTgU/Thjmfnva3rI/AAAAAAAAFHk/HseCnL8ZQXg/s400/IMG_2076.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The first meal I actually cooked though was pretty boring but still delicious, tofu stir-fry with turkish bread. Always a good safe option especially when getting used to a new kitchen.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TsBYltuXovg/ThjmhNEErEI/AAAAAAAAFHo/WIAmRaG5O8c/s400/IMG_2086.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I think I spent half the time trying to remember where I'd put everything and getting used to the fridge being in the laundry. Sounds weird but it actually works fine and that means we have more space in the kitchen.

<p>Next up is a rice and veggie casserole which is based on the Cheezy Broccoli and Rice Casserole from The Ultimate Uncheese Cookbook. I liked the concept of this and the taste was pretty awesome too but there was far too much rice to veggies even though I had added more veggies than the recipe originally said. Although I didn't have a cup measure and I think the cup I used for the rice was, well, definitely larger than your average! But still, it definitely needs some modification to reach a level of awesomeness!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-adJPPuq_mOw/Thjmi-8pboI/AAAAAAAAFHs/0PbSaTTMBbo/s400/IMG_2087.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yes, it looks quite good in the photo above but the veggies (and beans) are all on the top and the rice is all underneath in a thick mass.

<p>Another night I made a delicious wintery scone-topped casserole (you can tell it's pretty wintery round here by these last two dishes...-3 the other morning when we biked to work!). This has to be one of my favourite winter dishes and you can make it with pretty much anything you have on hand.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EvWu4E4-hrM/Thjmm8fmbcI/AAAAAAAAFH4/5Vd_So0Pn_s/s400/IMG_2095.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The casserole part of this dish has onion, carrot, cauliflower, celery, pumpkin and tinned sweetcorn with a tin of butter beans and a creamy sauce (pretty much just oat milk, flour and sweet chilli sauce). You cook all that up then dollop spoonfuls of scone mixture on top and bake for about 15 minutes at a super hot temperature. Voila, an awesome winter dish that is also brilliant the next day or even frozen.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-L5-ckzjRoAo/ThjmoE5aQLI/AAAAAAAAFH8/OWcR_BlRjgA/s400/IMG_2097.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, that's enough food for now. I am so tired! It's been so busy since moving and last night we had M's parents over for an awesome feast (which I will blog about shortly) and today we went for a lovely bike ride (route is </span></span><a href="http://nz.mapometer.com/en/cycling/route_1375407.html"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>) so I feel about ready to fall asleep on my seat. I wish we had a couch!

<p>Oh, and for anyone interested, our new flat is in the white zone which means it hasn’t been assessed yet but I can’t see any reason for it to be classed as orange or red so I think we’re pretty safe. It’s got the usual cracks that every house in this city now has but it all seems pretty superficial. If you are interested, there is more information about the zones </p></span></span><a href="http://www.landcheck.org.nz/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>. It is about whether the land is safe to live on rather than whether the structures themselves are safe (that’s different again - but appears to have a similar colour scheme as far as I can tell).</span></span>
