            <h1><a href="../../../../winter-comfort/">Winter comfort</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>It's a bit chaotic round here at the moment. So much to do before we leave to head overseas and I'm getting so nervous. Race notes and rules seem to be coming out thick and fast and it's all a bit overwhelming. Plus I've never been further than Australia before. I should be excited but I'm currently just a bit terrified!</p>

<p>Anyway, while I attempt to assemble some kind of order I will leave you with some of the more exciting food we've been eating this winter (in amongst the standard stir frys and all that jazz).</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-sL1y0hA0bLg/U9NyfKar2aI/AAAAAAAAFvo/3TU9sMX2MEM/s500/IMG_8598.JPG" alt=""></p>

<p>One of my favourite dishes is the Lime Peanut Noodles with Seitan, Kale and Carrots recipe from <a href="http://www.bookdepository.com/Vegan-Yum-Yum-Lauren-Ulm/9780757313806">Vegan Yum Yum</a>. Well, I've never actually make it with seitan. Normally we just make it with a particular tofu that I get at the Funky Pumpkin (thinly sliced and fried) and we just use what ever vegetables we have on hand. Mushrooms, onion, capsicum, courgette, broccoli, spinach...all good things! It's even good cold or at room temperature inbetween <a href="../../../../the-24hr-hens-party/">TWALK legs</a>!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ib_Y7NIJZfw/U9Ny4twZLuI/AAAAAAAAFv0/bejV75L9Cyo/s500/macncheez.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Also awesome is the vegan mac and cheez from <a href="http://yeahthatveganshit.blogspot.co.nz/2007/10/creamiest-vegan-mac-n-cheez-ever.html">Yeah That "Vegan Shit</a>. I normally fry an onion and, if I'm feeling virtuous, some veggies to go in it too. And, because I'm lazy, it's really easy to just make in one pot rather than the 2 mentioned in the recipe. Seems to taste just as good to me! It's a great winter comfort food and delicious with salad.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-qMF1DqtlJ3g/U9NziNUq6MI/AAAAAAAAFwA/TYTLpDCi-OQ/s500/corn-1.jpeg" alt=""></p>

<p>Also good with salad is the <a href="http://tvnz.co.nz/good-morning/simon-holst-s-recipes-pumpkin-cakes-corn-chip-casserole-2-june-2762424">Corn Chip Casserole</a> from Alison and Simon Holst's <a href="http://www.fishpond.co.nz/Books/Very-Easy-Vegetarian-Alison-Holst-Simon-Holst/9781877246739">Very Easy Vegetarian</a>. It's not too hard to veganise. Just make up a white/cheezy sauce with soy milk and yeast flakes (well, obviously a few other ingredients like cornflour to thicken it, some olivani or other vegan margarine type thing and a nice little shake of smoked paprika is always a good thing) and you're good to go.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-awKCBhXJaLk/U9Ny468qkMI/AAAAAAAAFv4/Rf2hN9p9GMU/s500/pumpkin-soup.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>But for real winter comfort food you really can't go past Pumpkin soup. All you need is a pumpkin (obviously), onion, some delicious spices (like a mild curry powder, cumin, ground coriander, smoked paprika...), some vegetable stock (I just use water and stock powder - the <a href="http://www.rapunzel.de/uk/index.html">Rapunzel</a> vegetable bouillon is my favourite) and something to blend it up with (here's where a stick blender is awesome). Easy! Well, apart from cutting up the pumpkin which I delegate M to do! Super delicious served with hot scones (I veganise the Edmonds scone recipe - it's awesome every time). The above scones are even cheese ones as I bought the <a href="http://www.buteisland.com/a_cheddar_chives.htm">Sheese Cheddar Cheese and Chives</a> at <a href="http://www.pikowholefoods.co.nz/">Piko</a> I didn't end up liking all that much. It made excellent cheese scones though!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../mint-chocolate-paradise/">Mint chocolate paradise</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Chocolate! Now that's something we haven't had on the blog for a little while. Time to remedy that.</p>

<p>My work is near <a href="http://www.libertymarketnz.com/">Liberty Market</a> so most weeks I head over there to check out what they've got. Their stock seems to be fairly sporadic and you'll often find things you like only to have them never get them in again (sign). But they do always have a steady supply of interesting chocolates and this particular day my eye was caught...</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-Cp-s54Jm9LA/U7aAWN2XZfI/AAAAAAAAFs0/X0rYUavPono/s400/pana-chocolate-01.jpg" alt="Pana Mint Chocolate"></p>

<p>Vegan mint chocolate? You've basically sold me already! It wasn't until I got it home that I realised it was raw chocolate (I must be going blind because it says it nice and bold on the front of the box) which did have me a little anxious at first because I've only tried one brand of raw chocolate I liked (and I have tried several). But from the moment I unwrapped it and the beautiful minty chocolate smell wafted out I was in chocolate heaven!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-iaGOl4gVOa8/U7aAWQcIT2I/AAAAAAAAFs4/gPKxTFh-qus/s400/pana-chocolate-02.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The texture is super smooth and creamy and it had a pretty strong mint flavour which I love. No point in being mint flavoured if you can't really taste it. It's quite soft so you do know you're not eating regular chocolate but I guess it's kind of like a truffle texture.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-_ebg3Y_g8Ak/U7aAWFY6CFI/AAAAAAAAFs8/Bu4SL7VvfOM/s400/pana-chocolate-03.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>And I must have really liked it since I bought another box of this <a href="http://www.panachocolate.com/">Pana Chocolate</a> on my latest trip to Liberty! In the interests of being a good blogger I probably should have bought a different flavour but I guess the other flavours don't tempt me enough to spend that kind of money. The way to my heart is clearly through mint chocolate!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../eating-salad/">Eating salad</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>I've never been a salad fan and although I would eat it I general wouldn't have gone out of my way to make one. So I don't know what changed but this summer I've been in to salads in a big way. Most days at work I have salad for lunch which I make up in the morning and sometimes I'll make one on the side for dinner as well.</p>

<p>Here's Friday night's lazy dinner of salad and 'cheese on toast' (well on the delicious ciabatta buns they sell at our local New World). This is the blue Redwood Cheezly one. I've taken to ordering several different cheeses online from <a href="http://www.thecrueltyfreeshop.co.nz/">The Cruelty Free Shop</a> up in Auckland every now and then. My favourite is still the Sheese smoked cheddar but the Vegusto ones are pretty good. I'm looking forward to trying <a href="http://www.angelfood.co.nz">Angel Food</a>'s new cheese next time.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-o-EwMXTU0oI/U4GVCl3ZhCI/AAAAAAAAFnk/6s5veZmAAMo/s640/salad%252Bcheese.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, I got sidetracked! Right, where was I? Oh, salad. Right. Friday's salad consisted of spinach (not baby spinach but good old spinach - probably my favourite salad green - I chop it up so you don't get big leaves which I don't really like), grated carrot, capsicum, tomatoes, pepperdews (sweet piquanté peppers), sundried tomatoes, dates, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds. Delicious! The dressing was our favourite Chermoula Dressing from the first <a href="http://www.revive.co.nz/info/revive-home/the-revive-cafe-cookbook">Revive cookbook</a>. I really like this dressing but you don't want to spill it on your clothes because it stains pretty bad (all the tumeric and cumin in it).</p>

<p>Today, after a morning ride on the tandem, we were in need of something to, umm, snack on whilst we caught up on the Giro action (M has turned me into a cycling addict). For some unknown reason I decided that I would try making the Peanut Butter Blondies that I'd seen on <a href="http://www.neverhomemaker.com/2014/05/healthy-peanut-butter-blondies.html">Neverhomemaker</a>. I say 'for some unknown reason' because normally I would turn my nose up at baking something sweet that contained a can of beans or chickpeas.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nZ1VPMv4W9M/U4GVYplk_aI/AAAAAAAAFns/midKd5H7Uj8/s400/blondie.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Anyway, it was made and we ate it and it wasn't too bad! Probably quite good really! I think I would make it again for lunches and stuff but not for something special. Yummy but tasted a bit too <em>healthy!!</em></p>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>This week marks my 3 year anniversary of moving to Christchurch and despite how crazy it has been it was definitely the best decision I could have made.</p>

<p>It's definitely been a 'different' experience though. I never thought I would be sent home from work or have the day off for earthquakes, snow and flooding (fortunately not all at the same time!) but there you go! This year has been the year of far too much rain resulting in pretty bad flooding across many parts of the city and, since we live by the river, it has been an interesting experience to say the least.</p>

<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-9ByC8YwzJ0g/U3BnFb8velI/AAAAAAAAFmU/4-ShPKenlJ4/s640/flooding.jpg" alt="">
</p><p style="text-align:center"><em>Somewhere under all that water is a road on either side of the river!</em></p>

<p>During the biggest flood, in March, we couldn't get out our driveway (well, we could if we'd really had to but it sure didn't look like fun). Fortunately we are high enough that the flooding doesn't affect our house but it's still pretty scary.</p>

<p>In more tasty news, I have just discovered a new vegan coconut yoghurt at my local supermarket. Doctors Choice Bio Yoghurt, a local Christchurch company, makes a <a href="http://www.bioyog.co.nz/dairy-free-coconut-yoghurt/">dairy-free coconut yoghurt</a> and it's really delicious!</p>

<p><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-uuhSTIc0wRo/U3BlVGrJswI/AAAAAAAAFl8/K8yGr2mW1VM/s400/yoghurt.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Seriously, if you see it I recommend trying it. Although I suspect it might only be stocked in the South Island at the moment.</p>

- <em>The Mischief of the Mistletoe</em> by Lauren Willig</span></p>

<p>I totally meant to post last week but, well, time slipped through my fingers. Not really that surprising if you'd seen my week/weekend.</p>

<p>Anyway, my parents came to visit us at the beginning of February which was very exciting (and stressful at the same time). They spent two weekends with us with the week between spent walking the Banks Peninsula. While they were with us we took them up into the Port Hills to show them the places we haunt in the evenings and weekends. We also drove over the hill to Governors Bay for a spot of lunch at <a href="http://www.shechocolat.com/">She Chocolat</a>. We had to wait forever for food but it was delicious. Plus the chef is always open to recreating something deliciously vegan.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-jBTQVhdUH8Y/T1nHPfH10jI/AAAAAAAAFY4/Q_3_KUtzJoY/s640/visit02.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
We also went to check out the <a href="http://www.restart.org.nz/">Re:START mall</a>. For those of you who don't know, the Re:START mall (where the Cashel Street mall used to be before the February 2011 earthquake caused much of it to be demolished) consists of shops made from shipping containers refitted as retail premises. It's actually really cool. I love the bright colours and the innovative and creative feel about the place. It definitely exceeded my expectations (plus I bought marzipan chocolate so what's not to love!).

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-ZyYlt6-r-rs/T1nHRFfixcI/AAAAAAAAFZA/-nxHoboC_T8/s640/visit01.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
This was actually the first time I'd been right up to the fences surrounding the red zone and it had an eery, unsettling feeling about it. I kind of expected tumbleweed to come rolling across the streets and perhaps a man on a horse to appear (a bit like some apocalyptic Western or something). Generally we avoid most of the earthquake damage and carry on with life as usual (life as usual does include not even noticing damage or demolished buildings and cracks in the road...it's like it just washes over you after a while).

<p>I haven't felt an aftershock in a while but I've learnt you can't get too relaxed (especially after the ones on 23rd December which found me climbing up in the ceiling checking to see what had happened to our header tank after water was coming down through the hot water cupboard).</p>
