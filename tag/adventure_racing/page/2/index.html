Ooo, today is a good day! I've just entered a longish adventure race in mid-January with a friend of mine so am very excited about that (yep, people do say I'm slightly crazy but everyone needs a slice of craziness in their lives). Better start getting my milage up in preparation! This is also my last day of work for the year (scary thought...not back till mid January unless something comes up earlier).</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, back to the food. It was my brother's birthday earlier in the week so naturally that called a celebration and cake.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SylXUcHOpYI/AAAAAAAADKM/diJMCs78lH4/s400/IMG_3019.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I made my go-to carrot cake from </span></span><a href="http://squirrelsvegankitchen.com/"><span><span>The Damn Tasty Vegan Baking Guide</span></span></a><span><span> (this time I used pear puree instead of apple sauce and dates instead of raisins) and, as usual, it was delicious and perfect. I love this recipe (if you don't have this book, it's </span></span><em><span><span>almost</span></span></em><span><span> identical to the one in Kris' other book, </span></span><a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/cookbook/"><span><span>100 Best Vegan Baking Recipes</span></span></a><span><span>).

<p>We had dinner at my parents house and I brought along some </p></span></span><a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/products/veg-express-sausage-rolls/"><span><span>Fry's vegetarian sausage rolls</span></span></a><span><span> to add to my dinner.

My cousin D decided she wanted to try a bit and reckoned they tasted remarkably like the real thing. I'm never sure if this is a good thing, a bad thing or just a thing but I guess if your average person thinks they taste good (whether it tastes like the real thing or not) then that's gotta be a good thing.

<p>Cake...good for my tummy!</p>

We've got our family Christmas party on Saturday night...ARGH!!! I can't believe how fast this year has gone. It's crazy. Feels like only a few months ago it was Christmas last year! Come back next time for lots of Christmas food...there are going to be a few busy days in the kitchen ahead.</span></span>

<p>I arrived home last night cold and wet after some training in the rain to discover a package waiting for me inside. I was so excited that I started opening right there and then, all the while dripping on the carpet! Yay, my package swap from Emma of <a href="http://studentveganuk.blogspot.com/"><span><span>Student Vegan from the UK</span></span></a><span><span> had arrived (Emma, I hope mine hasn't got lost in the mail!). It totally made my night!</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sfdv_Dps65I/AAAAAAAACEo/DBxcg_we6MY/s400/IMG_2142.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The package was filled with a whole lot of bars from </span></span><a href="http://www.naturalbalancefoods.co.uk/"><span><span>Natural Balance Foods</span></span></a><span><span> which we can't get here in New Zealand, an apple pie lara bar and some stir-fry sauce. It all looked so delicious and I can't wait to try everything.

<p>Now over the weekend we've been down at a place called </p></span></span><a href="http://www.mountainvalley.co.nz/"><span><span>Mountain Valley</span></span></a><span><span> which is, if you know your way around New Zealand, between Napier and Taupo off SH5. We stayed in this gorgeous little A-frame chalet  looking down towards the Mohaka River.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SfUAewhzMHI/AAAAAAAACEc/LZ0jRlxQUWc/s400/IMG_2129.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The scenery was so beautiful and everything was so peaceful and still...but I wasn't down there for a relaxing weekend. My team and I were down there for the </span></span><a href="http://www.autumnchallenge.co.nz/"><span><span>Macpac Autumn Challenge Women's Adventure Race</span></span></a><span><span>, quite the opposite of relaxing and peaceful!

<p>The race starts off with a mad dash to the rafts where you pair up with another team and paddle 18km down the Mohaka River. It's incredibly scenic but it's difficult to take in with burning arms and the sound of your rafting guide pushing you to paddle faster!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SfUASowl4-I/AAAAAAAACEU/fr4_OwZhfNA/s400/IMG_2090.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Once at the end of the rafting you've then got to hop on your bike for a very steep ride/push pretty high up into the surrounding mountains before decending back down to the river for the final stage.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SfUAZMLBrNI/AAAAAAAACEY/Zw4Y9YA5rto/s400/IMGP2717.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The last section (our team's strength) is on foot where you must navigate yourself to the checkpoints marked on your maps and then back to the finish. We made it back just as the light was beginning to fade to be greeted by the cheers of our support crew and the wafting smell of dinner being cooked. Awesome :)

<p>After the race they provided dinner which, unlike last year, had some great vegetarian options. I fueled up on vege burgers and an awesome curried rice...much needed after a hard day's racing. No pictures but trust me, it was delicious!</p></span></span>

<p>It's been pretty hectic round here lately...</p>

<p>The weekend after we got back from our South Island adventure I was competing in <a href="http://www.madeventz.co.nz/tonic/">TONIC</a> (The Orienteering North Island Champs), 4 days of full-on racing on various maps in Woodhill Forest. From fast, open forest to thick native bush to the Maze, an open area filled with impassable patches of scrub that proved a technical minefield it was one very intense weekend.</p>

<em>Fruit salad in the sun after Day 3's racing. Glorious.</em></center>

<p>The next weekend was spent putting in some last minute mountain bike training at <a href="http://www.bikepark.co.nz/">Woodhill</a> before competing in the <a href="http://www.lacticturkey.co.nz/P6Home.htm">P6</a> the following weekend. The P6 is an annual 6 hour adventure race held North of Auckland by <a href="http://www.lacticturkey.co.nz/">Lactic Turkey</a>, known for some pretty fun and crazy events. This was no exception. The event involved mountain biking (always my bane), running and tubbing (swimming down a river inside an inner tube from a car tyre) as well as mystery activities to earn extra points all while trying to navigate your way around the course.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SRpJglBE_yI/AAAAAAAABco/ACLfEHdMMSo/s400/P6_planning_01.jpg" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Chaos as the beginning of leg 2 as everyone tries to work out exactly what's going on.</em></center>

<p>The P6 was our first race together as just the 2 of us and hopefully not our last. Just next time we'll remember to bring sunblock!</p>

<p>While visiting my new local health food shop, <a href="http://www.huckleberryfarms.co.nz/">Huckleberry Farms</a>, in search of <a href="https://www.larabar.com/">lara bars</a> for the various races I discovered they now also stock a selection of Clif and Luna bars so obviously I had to get some to test...</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SRn8zQPUJLI/AAAAAAAABb4/Icmqh3oPmpc/s400/IMG_1095.JPG" alt="" title=""></center>

<p>First up, <a href="http://www.lunabar.com/">Luna Bars</a>. So far I've tried Caramel Nut Brownie, Cookies 'n Cream Delight and Chocolate Peppermint Stick. Honestly? They taste kinda artificial or something but I keep desperately trying to like them (they look so pretty after all!). Perhaps a non-chocolate flavour will be better. I have an Iced Oatmeal Raisin flavour so I'm hanging great hopes on it!</p>

<p><a href="http://www.clifbar.com/">Clif Bars</a>. Here I've only tried the Chocolate Brownie and Oatmeal Raisin Walnut flavours and J has tried the Cranberry Apple Cherry. I definitely prefer the Clif bars to the Luna bars but the Chocolate Brownie was way too dense and sweet, especially before a race! Next time, stick to the fruity, oatmeal flavours!</p>

<p>So basically, Lara Bars win hands down! I've yet to meet a flavour I don't like.</p>

<p>Amongst all our adventuring we've still had to eat. Here's last night's dinner - <a href="http://www.delmaine.co.nz/products.cfm?prod_id=1533&amp;start_pos=21&amp;prod_type_id=154">Pumpkin Gnocchi</a> with soy sausages, capsicum, courgette, mushrooms, baby spinach and tinned tomatoes. One day I will have to try my hand at making gnocchi but for now <a href="http://www.delmaine.co.nz/">Delmaine</a> make a pretty good version for those days you don't have much time to spend in the kitchen (like every day lately!).</p>

            <p></p><p><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">In my family, we seem to have a tortured history of not saying what we ought to and not meaning what we do. Kate covers her mouth with her hand. She backs out of the kitchen door, bumping into my father, who fumbles by cannot catch her as she scrambles upstairs. I hear the door to our room slam shut. My mother, of course, goes after her.</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br>
</span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">So I do what I do best. I move in the opposite direction.</span></span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> <br>
</span><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">- </span><em><span style="font-size: x-small;">My Sister's Keeper</span></em><span style="font-size: x-small;"> by Jodi Picoult</span></span> <br>
<span><span> <br>
</span></span><span><span><span>I've done quite a few different sporting events in my time: orienteering of all descriptions (even relays in the dark!), rogaining and both road and off road running races but up until recently I'd never tried my hand at adventure racing. The Macpac Autumn Challenge Women’s Adventure Race seemed like the perfect place to start. You compete in teams of 3 and the race involves rafting, hiking/running and mountain biking all the while navigating where you are supposed to go. Well, I’m terrified of falling into the water (I’m fine if I’m swimming in it) and I truly suck at biking, let alone mountain biking. But hey, I can run and I sure can navigate so there was nothing really to lose.After a 2 hour crash course in mountain biking with J and his friends at the </span></span></span><a href="http://www.bikepark.co.nz/"><span><span><span>Woodhill Bike Park</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> (as well as a bit of road cycling and spin class) I was fairly confident that I could get round without too much disaster. After all, the event info had said that limited experience was fine as it wouldn't be too tricky. Little did I know what was ahead...but hindsight is a wonderful thing!</span></span></span></p>

<p>The race was based in Taupo and the night before involved a crash course in rafting followed by race briefing and the handing out of maps. At briefing we also got our race packs which, for once, contained something I could actually eat, mini <a href="http://www.larabar.com/"><span><span><span>Lara bars</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>!! I managed to score 3 different types: pistachio, cashew cookie and cherry pie.J and my friend from Palmerston North were on support crew duty which basically meant making sure everything was ready for us at transition points like moving the bikes (and pumping tires, testing gears and any other bike maintenance between thrashings), lining up clothing or footwear changes, and making sure liquid and food were waiting ready for us at each transition. Oh, and taking photos of us looking rather the worse for wear!!</span></span></span></p>

<p>The race started at the Taupo equestrian centre with a 1.5km run to the rafts (over some equestrian water jumps!) where you then paddled 8km down the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waikato_River"><span><span><span>Waikato River</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> to the next transition point. You then hopped onto your bike for a 15km mountain bike back to the start area. Here you dumped your bikes and set off on an 11km run along the edge of the river up to the </span></span></span><a href="http://www.hukafalls.com/"><span><span><span>Huka Falls</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> to the third transition area. Here you jumped back on your bike and headed up into the Craters of the Moon (Wairakei Forest) single track mountain bike trails. Once at the </span></span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craters_of_the_Moon_%28geothermal_site%29"><span><span><span>Craters of the Moon</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> car park you ran round the boardwalk to collect clues then picked up your bike again and rode back to the transition area again where you then navigated your way to Spa Park where there would be a short orienteering course leading to the finish. Confused yet? Exhausted?!</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I could give you a run down of the event but that would take ages (well, it was a LONG race…we finished in about 8 hours 54 minutes) so I’ll give you some highlights (or lowlights depending on the angle you’re standing at!).</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span><span><span>the weather was not exactly pretty but not awful. It mostly drizzled all day. At least it wasn’t too cold though.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>wetsuits are not flattering on ANYONE but for some reason J enjoyed taking photos of us waddling around in them. They are also hellishly difficult to run in.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>the water level of the Waikato River was down quite a lot which meant not many rapids and therefore a whole lot more paddling to keep the raft moving. But I didn’t fall in so it was all good!</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/goddessvaala/Sport/photo?authkey=WJHm0_14dO8#5194162709490931810"><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/goddessvaala/SBVfduTJmGI/AAAAAAAAAeo/qWTb78eRoDE/s400/IMGP1612-1.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></a></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span><span><span>getting out of wetsuits and wet socks in a hurry is no easy task especially when your arms are dead from paddling hard out for an hour.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>my first fall from the bike came in the first section where I arrived at CP1 and skidded round the corner in the gravel right in front of one of our top adventure racers (and orienteers). I felt pretty embarrassed.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>somehow my tyre managed to be a bit flat by the end of the first mountain bike stage despite checking everything before the race. Lucky for support crews I guess (thanks J) so I didn’t have to fix anything!</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>the first running leg was along the edge of the Waikato River (after a brief struggle through some blackberry). One of our team members was struggling a bit so we just took it nice and easy (that’s what happens when you head out madly at the start).</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>we crossed the Huka Falls (always an impressive sight) twice – once during the first running leg when it was nice and quiet, and one on the last leg to the finish when it was covered in tourists and their umbrellas oblivious to the fact that we were in a race and therefore in a hurry to cross the bridge.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>I don’t think I ate very much at all during the race; just drunk water and </span></span></span><a href="http://www.mizone.co.nz/"><span><span><span>Mizone</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> Rapid and ate a little bit of </span></span></span><a href="http://www.whittakers.co.nz/"><span><span><span>Whittakers</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> dark Ghana chocolate and a couple of mini lara bars. You don’t really seem to feel like eating, just quick bursts of energy to keep you going. The main thing is not to get dehydrated which is where the Mizone comes in.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>the second mountain bike leg was an absolute killer. Not only are the tracks in there rough, narrow, incredibly windy and steep but the map we were given of the tracks was not particularly accurate.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/goddessvaala/Sport/photo?authkey=WJHm0_14dO8#5194162718080866418"><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/goddessvaala/SBVfeOTJmHI/AAAAAAAAAew/j47iAO7V0pw/s400/IMGP1637-1.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></a></span></p>

<ul>
<li><span><span>I had a few impressive falls off my bike in the forest during the second mountain bike leg. One of my team mates was not so lucky as she came off in the gravel and ended up with blood everywhere.</span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>my other team member had her bike break on her about two thirds of the way through the second mountain bike leg! The back gear thingy (see, I know heaps about bikes!!) broke and we had to break the chain off so she could wheel it out.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>by the time the chain on my bike came off and got stuck I was too weak to tip my bike over to fix it but the spirit out there was amazing as another team stopped to help me. Luckily it was fixable (but took some serious work).</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>I had no idea there were places in Taupo like Craters of the Moon (the board walk we had to run around after the second mountain bike leg). It’s a highly active geothermal area NW of Taupo and really awesome.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>we finished the third leg of the mountain bike just slightly too late to do the orienteering section. </span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>Ironic really since this was going to be the part I was going to (finally) excel in!</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>the final run to the finish was beautiful. There are parts of the Waikato River which are so clear you can see right down to the rocks at the bottom.</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>our support crew were asleep in the car by the finish line when we came in…</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>even my jaw was weak by the time we finished ‘cause I was exhausted just trying to chew through my dinner!</span></span></span></li>
<li><span><span><span>we all got a free lunch the following day! Which we followed up by eating copious amounts of sorbet!!</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>So after all that will I do another adventure race? Hell yes. But next time I will do a whole lot more mountain bike training!</span></span></span> </p>
