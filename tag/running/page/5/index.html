<span><span> <br>
My lovely cousin D decided she wanted to compete in a running race and chose the 6km </span></span><a href="http://www.totalsport.co.nz/events/coastal/index.php"><span><span>North Shore Coastal Classic</span></span></a><span><span> as her first attempt and I accompanied her round the course. She did an amazing job, running almost the whole way while I talked my head off and probably drove everyone else around us a little crazy! It was a nice gentle cruise for me which was a good recovery after the day before and the weather was glorious so all in all it was a good day.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S4sggHCHFBI/AAAAAAAADeM/F7-oGUtiO9I/s400/IMG_3344.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, after the race I whipped us up some food from her Christmas present to me, <a href="http://www.bookdepository.co.uk/book/9781600940002/Anis-Raw-Food-Kitchen">Ani's Raw Food Kitchen</a> (admittedly we only just exchanged gifts last week 'cause we're a bit behind the times!). First up was a scramble using the Love the Chicks Pate as the base with diced tomato, capsicum, avocado and baby spinach.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S4sgMQ-dUGI/AAAAAAAADeI/EIdRCWyDuHo/s400/IMG_3349.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was the recipe that caught my eye when I first picked this book up ages ago on a typical browse in Borders and I knew it was the first thing I wanted to make when I got the book. It was super easy to make (chuck everything in the food processor and off you go then stir in your veggies...easy as pie) and tasted really good but it was very rich especially after all that time out in the sun and we didn't end up eating that much.

<p>The second course was the Coconut Breakfast Cakes with maple syrup and melon. I ended up using LSA instead of ground flaxseed and mixed in chopped walnuts and blueberries too.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S4sgK0tnwUI/AAAAAAAADeE/FHWw0UvaBJ8/s400/IMG_3353.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Now these were delicious which totally surprised me 'cause when I first read the ingredients I couldn't understand how they could taste good. The LSA I used (and the flaxseed I buy) is obviously a much darker colour to what she used 'cause mine came out a lot darker than the picture but oh well! I will definitely make these again and mix up the ingredients and additions even more.

<p>On Sunday night The Chef and I hit up the Lantern Festival at Albert Park in the city (along with his family and the entire population of Auckland it seemed!). I wish I'd taken my camera 'cause we got some awesome (and crazy) food and there were some beautiful lights. Veg "chicken" nuggets, veg "corn dogs" (ewww!), BBQ corn, banana leaf rice with bean curd, vietnamese spring rolls (also not that crash hot unfortunately) and freshly squeezed orange juice. There was so much more to try too but my stomach was too full by then!</p>

<p>Anyway, it's the year of the tiger and tigers are my favourite animal so that rocks (and the tiger lantern was beautiful - you can see a closeup of its face </p></span></span><a href="http://www.aucklandcity.govt.nz/whatson/events/lantern/Default.asp"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>)!</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
Monday was a public holiday round here so after a run in the mud in the </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/waitakere-ranges/"><span><span>Waitakeres</span></span></a><span><span> (I'm not sure if it's possible to go there and it not be muddy but I did chose a terribly wet and rainy day), I met my beautiful friend S for lunch at </span></span><a href="http://www.librarycafe.co.nz/"><span><span>The Library</span></span></a><span><span> (no, not the kind of library that houses books, but a local cafe! The building was, in fact, the old Onehunga library and, according to sources, has its very own ghost). We chose this place because I know one of the chefs and he promised me vegan pancakes! How could one possibly resist?! I don't think I've had pancakes that I haven't had to make myself in years!</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S2d2zGWZNOI/AAAAAAAADVY/Ctpd0RpJIlc/s400/IMG_3273.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Actually, the pancakes are always vegan (you just get maple syrup instead of honey and yogurt) but he wouldn't let me eat them unless they were fresh so it was my lucky day! They're also gluten-free which is a bonus if you can't have gluten. Oh, and they're very tasty!

<p>We also shared a berry-flavoured smoothie and S had peppermint tea.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S2d2yM1vHLI/AAAAAAAADVU/xWRUNcKoS-w/s400/IMG_3270.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Life is good!

<p>So then we went back to S's house and she had baked me a batch of vegan cupcakes!! How awesome! They are pumpkin and apple. Awesome.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S2ebroMEj2I/AAAAAAAADVs/TBp44h7_Sl8/s400/IMG_3278.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size:x-small;"><span>'Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice; 'but a grin without a cat! It's the most curious thing I ever saw in all my life!' <br>

<span><span> <br>
My final day in the garden city, Monday, dawned perfectly clear and fine so our mission was apparent...to climb outside at last! But first, breakfast...</span></span></p>

<p>We'd decided we were going to go back to <a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/">The Lotus Heart</a> to try out their breakfast menu. The sun was streaming in through the window by our table overlooking Cathedral Square and while we waited for our breakfast to be served I had a chai latte made with rice milk.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYprjd9mI/AAAAAAAAC7M/om6dkiOR6cQ/s400/IMG_2823.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Believe it or not I had never had french toast, vegan or not, until this morning. Once I tried to come here for brunch to order it but we missed brunch by about 10 minutes so today I was determined!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYrByC1RI/AAAAAAAAC7Q/FD4D_2H8sOY/s400/IMG_2825.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was so delicious - grainy bread for the french toast with caramalised bananas sandwiched in the middle and served with fresh fruit salad and maple syrup. It filled me up for hours. I'm going to have to learn how to make my own french toast now!

<p>After breakfast we let our food settle before I set off for a short run to stretch the legs and B biked round the block. We debated trying somewhere new for lunch but were running short on time so settled on going back to </p></span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=15666020981016691371&amp;q=soul+food,+christchurch"><span><span>Soul Food</span></span></a><span><span>. We both picked this delicious flavoured green tea drink to try...refreshing.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYtnLCZMI/AAAAAAAAC7Y/xZzZQkCUNCg/s400/IMG_2827.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was hoping they'd have a vegan BLT left but unfortunately we were obviously a bit late and the cafe had been super busy so there was none left so I ordered the vege burger (same as B ordered on Saturday) and salad instead.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYsSZxSoI/AAAAAAAAC7U/zWxDDh18nww/s400/IMG_2830.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Delicious (but not as good as the BLT). Why can't we have food like this easily accessible in Auckland? Or am I looking in all the wrong places?

<p>Anyway, after lunch we headed off to the Port Hills (the only real hills in Christchurch!) and to a patch of rock called Rapaki where we met up with one of B's climbing friends.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdtr6oe2I/AAAAAAAAC7g/7XXEaX9TU-w/s400/IMG_2917.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Climbing outside is quite different to climbing on a wall inside. For a start you can use anything you can as handholds or to put your feet but it isn't immediately obvious what you can use. We climbed fairly easy climbs since it was my first outdoor experience but it was still tough work as it was so different (and SO hot).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPd0VorA8I/AAAAAAAAC70/RNHm0Ijgbdo/s400/IMG_2890.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Look at that view off the side of the wall...it was such an amazing experience. I am totally doing this again (I've become seriously hooked on climbing).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdxI7XAyI/AAAAAAAAC7o/4C_-y4QpiFA/s400/IMG_2904.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
A glorious end to what was quite possibly one of the best weekends I've had in a long long time. As I hopped on the plane I was kind of wishing I didn't have to leave...although my body sure was glad to be able to resort to normal eating habits!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdyQZL7AI/AAAAAAAAC7s/2cXfNbO3d7A/s400/IMG_2843.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

<span><span> <br>
Sunday morning did not quite start off as planned (this being last Sunday, not today in case anyone was confused). We had planned to go to </span></span><a href="http://theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span> for brunch but it was closed. So off to the <a href="http://www.artscentre.org.nz/Weekend-market/marketsearch.asp">art centre market</a> it was for souvlaki from the Dimitri's stall instead! It might not be what I'd typically see as brunch food but you really can't go to Christchurch and not have a souvlaki.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYfFpCC0I/AAAAAAAAC6k/PZtG-bOj-Js/s400/IMG_2801.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yep, that's one HUGE falafel souvlaki because B made us both get doubles. Seriously could not finish this but it was delicious. We washed them down with fresh lemonade from the market whilst lazing in the sun. Awesome.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYgd_ioVI/AAAAAAAAC6o/rBEM5GnQFwo/s400/IMG_2802.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Once we got home we also might have snacked on some chocolate biscuits B had picked up from the supermarket...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYhrXvnsI/AAAAAAAAC6w/NfWpo2s-7f8/s400/IMG_2803.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Once brunch had settled (which took a hell of a long time!) we headed off to </span></span><a href="http://ecan.govt.nz/advice/recreation-and-parks/waimakariri-park/Pages/mcleans-island.aspx"><span><span>McLeans Island</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPd2BGDuGI/AAAAAAAAC74/gEisHgAGYeo/s400/IMG_2806.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
While B fitted in some mountain bike training I ran round the walking track and took the detour out to the river. I wish I'd had my camera out there as it was beautiful.

<p>Not much is open on a Sunday night in Christchurch but we did manage to find somewhere, the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thedux.co.nz/index.cfm/index.cfm/christchurch/home"><span><span>Dux de Lux</span></span></a><span><span>, which used to be a vegetarian restaurant/bar but has since added seafood to their menu. They still have a good selection of vegan options though. Both B and I picked options that we could share.

<p>My meal came with salad and I picked the rice and the carrot salads. Very tasty and I had to restrain myself from eating all of it whilst waiting for the rest of my meal to be served.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYi5AEfaI/AAAAAAAAC60/esOBtUdO6tM/s400/IMG_2811.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ordered the sweetcorn and vegetable fritters which came with a beetroot chutney.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYk_bg5KI/AAAAAAAAC68/V553WhePctA/s400/IMG_2815.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They were huge and delicious with a crunchy outside and a gooey, creamy inside and the chutney went really well. Filled the spot perfectly.

<p>B also picked the rice salad and also went with a couscous salad which we weren't fans of.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYj8c1qkI/AAAAAAAAC64/5i4HDjUk5BQ/s400/IMG_2813.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For his main B ordered the Indian curry which was served with rice, chapatti, raita and mango chutney.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYmKF08JI/AAAAAAAAC7A/6KsBTPvZ2rk/s400/IMG_2817.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The curry was pretty delicious and hearty but the chutney was best avoided...tasted like eating a really sweet mango jam which would be fine in some contexts but not this one.

<p>Because we were starving and getting quite good at ordering (and eating) WAY too much food, we also ordered some kumara fries on the side with sweet chilli sauce. I love kumara fries and we polished them all off despite being so full we couldn't move!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYnBxd3uI/AAAAAAAAC7E/CwyjvQCQrUU/s400/IMG_2819.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Because we hadn't had dessert (which was a requirement for the weekend challenge!) we made brownies (yes, crazy I know)!! Using an </span></span><a href="http://www.orgran.com/"><span><span>Orgran</span></span></a><span><span> Chocolate Muffin Mix, we followed the vegan version but used soy milk instead of water and added peanut butter and chopped chocolate (I think we got a bit carried away on the chocolate chopping front but hey, chocolate is all good) and then cooked it in a large square cake pan.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StTvkrJjpFI/AAAAAAAAC8A/3DYF1YJOAKk/s400/IMG_2821.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It turned out really well especially when served warm with </span></span><a href="http://www.icecream.co.nz/litelicks.cfm"><span><span>Lite Licks</span></span></a><span><span> Hokey Pokey ice cream. Just to state the obvious, I was ridiculously full after this again! Hmmm...perhaps the theme of the weekend?!</span></span></div>

<span><span> <br>
Saturday started with a slice of peanut butter and banana toast which I couldn't be bothered photographing since it was terribly unexciting and not part of our food challenge. Then we set off on a short run round </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagley_Park"><span><span>Hagley Park</span></span></a><span><span> from his flat (we are going to be doing </span></span><a href="http://www.lacticturkey.co.nz/P6.htm"><span><span>this</span></span></a><span><span> race together next month).</span></span></p>

<p>By the time we'd got back, found we were locked out in the freezing cold and rain (I was turning purple), knocked on people's doors to find a ladder, managed to scale the side of the house to get back inside and finally showered and defrosted, we were starving so we set off for lunch at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=15666020981016691371&amp;q=soul+food,+christchurch"><span><span>Soul Food</span></span></a><span><span>. It was a bit of a challenge to find but that may have been because we hadn't looked on the map beforehand and were starving!</span></span></p>

<p>I started with a drink...organic cola.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYVlWYolI/AAAAAAAAC6E/SOpp3LrL0-M/s400/IMG_2779.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It didn't last long.

<p>After reading about the Vegan BLT on </p></span></span><a href="http://fairestfeed.blogspot.com/"><span><span>The Fairest Feed</span></span></a><span><span> I knew as soon as I saw it in the counter that it was what I wanted.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYWuGfKsI/AAAAAAAAC6I/nbzplnNvS54/s400/IMG_2780.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I have to say that it totally lived up to expectations. It was SO good - the bread was deliciously fresh, the bacon was awesome but I think it was the sauces that really made it (vegan aioli or mayonaise?). The side salad was also delicious. So if you ever find yourself at Soul Food...get the BLT!

<p>B ordered the Vege Burger which was also vegan. This had a pattie made from brown rice (and a few other things) as well as vegan aioli and served inside a grainy bun.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYX1NnVxI/AAAAAAAAC6M/nI4V26zWWRo/s400/IMG_2783.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It was pretty tasty (I snuck a bit off his plate) but not nearly as good as the BLT.

<p>Finally they had some sweet vegan options so dessert was required. I got a muffin which I think was apricot and apple...maybe (okay, I'm sure about the apricot part but not about the apple part).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYZVfpW8I/AAAAAAAAC6Q/lGzGiEPtNNc/s400/IMG_2784.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It had a really nice texture which reminded me of spelt and a delicious dob of icing on top. Yay, lunch mission accomplished!

<p>After lunch (and having a bit of a lie-down after eating too much!) we headed off to </p></span></span><a href="http://www.theroxx.co.nz/"><span><span>The Roxx</span></span></a><span><span>, the indoor climbing wall at Christchurch. We were hoping to head outside for my first taste of climbing on real rock but the weather wasn't up for it.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdsO-KDeI/AAAAAAAAC7c/pjqs93p0o7Y/s400/IMG_2787.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The Roxx isn't nearly as big as </span></span><a href="http://extremeedge.co.nz/"><span><span>Extreme Edge</span></span></a><span><span> which is where I climb in Auckland but it has some pretty crazy climbs. Good fun but I was a bit disappointed we couldn't climb outside.

<p>Dinner was planned for </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span> restaurant in Cathedral Square, which we'd both been to before. Since we were running late we didn't bother going home to change and just rocked up in our climbing gear (minus the harnesses and stuff...we're not </span></span><em><span><span>that</span></span></em><span><span> crazy!).

<p>I am rather partial to a good ginger beer so when I noticed they had a housemade ginger beer on the menu that had to be ordered.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYaOKM4II/AAAAAAAAC6U/gz-IA9sN2lg/s400/IMG_2789.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Delicious (although it could have been a bit more gingery). I liked how it wasn't super fizzy either. We started off the meal with a bowl of fries with tomato sauce because, well, we could...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYbv1EyUI/AAAAAAAAC6Y/1yTLISiBuXE/s400/IMG_2792.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I don't know what kind of seasoning they used but it was very tasty.

<p>For some reason I really felt like a burger despite having had a sandwich for lunch and their Sun Burger caught my eye. It's described as a "live" burger pattie with salad, salsa and vegan aioli in an essene bun.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYc7dhbbI/AAAAAAAAC6c/U33LA1h9Oec/s400/IMG_2794.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was a seriously good burger - delicious and also a bit different. Their vegan aoli is really good and totally made the burger otherwise it might have potentially been a bit dry and helped make the burger not taste so dense. This meal was probably the highlight of the day.

<p>The Lotus Heart has an actual dessert menu and as a vegan you have more than one option! Having come here before I knew I had to try something different from </p></span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/10/city-of-tropics.html"><span><span>last time</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYeMjvajI/AAAAAAAAC6g/Gvfz387qkNE/s400/IMG_2799.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yeah, chocolate cake caught my eye! Served with raspberry sorbet (which was really good despite the fact I don't normally like berry sorbets) it was intensely rich and awesome. I didn't want it to end!</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>One of the major problems encountered in time travel is not that of accidentally becoming your own father or mother. There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well adjusted family can't cope with. There is also no problem about changing the course of history - the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end. <br>

A few things that help to brighten up bad days...</span></span></p>

<p>Scoring free bittersweet <a href="http://www.whittakers.co.nz/"><span><span>Whittakers</span></span></a><span><span> chocolate from the boys at the coffee shop across the road from work. They definitely know how to brighten a bad day.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqorcF1ZMOI/AAAAAAAAC0k/macDqL_Chuc/s400/IMG_2696.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Running especially as it becomes lighter in the mornings and I can run round the local parks instead of having to stick to the streets. It's even better when I have new running shoes (and having them contain some of my favourite colours). This morning it was light enough not long after 6am to run through the bush tracks in the </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Domain"><span><span>Auckland Domain</span></span></a><span><span>. Yay!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sp7c8CSLRLI/AAAAAAAACwo/wQjWbD7Xm8U/s400/IMG_2617.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Finding Vanilla Tofutti Cuties at the </span></span><a href="http://www.choosecrueltyfree.org.nz/"><span><span>Safe</span></span></a><span><span> store on K'Rd. This is the kind of thing I never thought we'd get here. I seriously could not believe how awesome these tasted. Hopefully we will get a few more flavours.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqorbYxAQkI/AAAAAAAAC0g/LpGKD7DRsmA/s400/IMG_2688.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Being out in the forest even on drizzly, wet days. Clears your head and frees your mind. My favourite thing to do out at the forest is orienteering...can't wait for the events this weekend.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sq6yc9MlTjI/AAAAAAAAC1E/UW5nbrK7OLg/s400/IMG_2702.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

My sweet flatmate's bliss balls. She made them super peanut buttery! What's not to love?!
