            <h1><a href="../../../../rogaine_3_slater_road/">Rogaine 3 - Slater Road</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Oh my god, this was epic! Okay, well I knew that from the moment I heard there was going to be a rogaine at Slater Road but when I got the map my fears were well and truly confirmed. Slater Road is the map of Rob and Marquita's farm...mostly a huge pine forest out the back filled with mountain bike trails. What makes it so tough is just how steep it is (and I mean steep) and the forest is not clean running like much of the pine forest we run in at Woodhill.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/73SgWimBvQsohmwhloOrECkT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S_Sbg1EcOhI/AAAAAAAADvY/wZYkIhn0W_A/s400/Rogaine%203%20-%20Slater%20Road.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
So I picked up the map and really had no idea where I was going to go. In hindsight (what a wonderful thing) I probably should have taken the advice I gave my parents (!) and tried to get a whole heap of the farmland controls which were on the flatter area and definitely easier to get to. Instead I headed straight out into the bush and spend a good 75 minutes bashing about in it before picking up some of the farmland controls on my way back to the finish.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S_CKKIbr0ZI/AAAAAAAADtM/PALD6Lkwxtw/s400/Rogaine%20%26%20MTBO010.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Looking down to the event centre (where the hut is under the trees...which are all part of the map).</em></center> <br>
I didn't get nearly as many points as I hoped for (well, I guess at least I didn't plan too cautiously this time then!) but at least managed to work out a route to get back to the finish without being over the time limit, picking up a few points along the way.

<p>Despite everything it was good fun and I definitely pushed myself physically up some of those climbs. I really love this forest but it is real steep and super technical. I mean, I've run and biked up here heaps lately but I still get confused every time I go out! It's a bit of a shame I won't be around for the final rogaine in the series as I'll be in Christchurch for another event. Oh well, can't do everything I guess!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../rogaine_2_turkey_ridge/">Rogaine 2 - Turkey Ridge</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Turkey Ridge is one of the few farmland maps we have in the Auckland region and I think it's been a couple of years since I last ran there (I vaguely remember it was overcast and I stuffed up somewhere stupid but really that's not that uncommon!). It's steep...lots of contours, made worse by the fact the map uses 5 metre contours (that means that it's 5 metres in height between each contour line on the map...does that makes sense?).</p>

<p>Anyway, I was determined to plan my route better this time and be a bit more ambitious. Turns out I was probably still not ambitious enough but we'll get to that. When we got handed the maps it was raining so I went back to my car to plan my route so had no idea what other people were planning and just hoped I hadn't picked a stupid route. Obviously not as there was a huge train of us heading to #54 as their first control.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/Rpv2OXi26sU7bi0BaOCSnCkT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-dEtAMbnlI/AAAAAAAADs0/OluqDVf802U/s400/Rogaine%202%20-%20Turkey%20Ridge.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
I got round most of the loop on the right-hand side of the track within 30 minutes so I realised then that I was going to have to head further out to the left than planned. As it turns out, I had a very similar route to another girl in my grade so we were sort of racing each other for most of the time. Every time I thought I was taking a different route she'd show up next to me a couple of controls later! It did help push me onwards a bit though.

<p>Once I got to #36 I gave myself a turnaround time (I think I had about 50 minutes to go at that point) but I didn't stick to it and turned around earlier than I needed to, mainly because the other girl and another guy who'd joined our little party were turning around at that point. I could have at least got #49 and maybe #56 and then dropped #41 later on which was so steep it wasn't really worth it. I ended up crossing past the finish with about 17 minutes to go. Picked up the last 3 I'd left for a finishing loop and was home with about 9 and a half minutes to spare and nowhere to use them up! GRRR! But I ended up with 1020 points which was pretty good really and got me 2nd equal in open women which was quite good.</p>

<p>Can't wait for next weekend though...Slater Road rocks and we have a mountain bike rogaine in the afternoon. Gonna be awesome.</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../adventures_in_queenstown/">Adventures in Queenstown</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>I've been in Queenstown all week on a work trip but you can't come all the way down here and not try and see at least some of the cool sights. I've been starting work at 9am every morning and it doesn't really get light enough to venture out until about 7:15am and even then you wouldn't want to be in the bush until more like 7:45am so that leaves me a tiny window in which to sneak in some runs and unfortunately means I haven't been able to do my favourite one (the One Mile Creek/Fernhill loop). But I have managed to sneak in a couple of my favourites so far...</p>

<p>Yesterday, after doing intervals and hill sprints the day before, I thought I'd tackle Queenstown Hill. Poor thighs were burning a bit after the hills of the day before but hey, at least they were still working! It's a bit of a grind to get to the base of the track which is, ironically, not at the base of the hill since you have to climb up some wickedly steep streets first. Then you wind up through the bush loop track which was pretty dark on my way up. Once you get up above the bush you keep following the track to the summit through the tussock...I've never come up here (winter, summer, spring, autumn...I think I might have been here for every season!) and not been freezing no matter how many layers I had...but the views are always amazing.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's a few snapshots of the run (mostly from the open tops section)...</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-H565-uaXI/AAAAAAAADr4/RmopAcGqSgw/s400/IMG_3588.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Here is the view of Queenstown Hill from the deck of my apartment. Obviously this is a bit later in the day since, well, you can actually see it as opposed to when I left yesterday and it was still dark.</em></center> <br>
<center><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-H53ooAkBI/AAAAAAAADrw/PPzEXa2mpsE/s400/IMG_3557.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Once you get above the tree line you can either head back down the loop track or head up to the summit. Why you'd come all this way and not go to the summit though is beyond me.</em></center> <br>
<center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-H5ufevbDI/AAAAAAAADrg/4ClOQih3HeA/s400/IMG_3546.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Looking down over Queenstown from above the treeline. You can see the sun is still trying to make it's way over the tops of the mountains.</em></center> <br>
<center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-H5yMBoYKI/AAAAAAAADro/4BIpzHoD3wM/s400/IMG_3554.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Yay! I've made it to the summit! Here we're looking out towards Ben Lomond which I've climbed on a previous adventure here when there was a lot more snow.</em></center> <br>
<center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-H5vwvuCdI/AAAAAAAADrk/74Bhux4YFEw/s400/IMG_3553.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Looking down towards the lake and the mountains beyond from the summit. Wicked morning.</em></center> <br>

<em>Quite possibly the most unflattering photo of me I've ever seen! Trying to take a photo at the summit was hard...it was bloody freezing (and I'd forgotten my gloves) and you could only take it from one angle 'cause the sun was still in the process of rising (it has a long way to rise to get above the mountains round here).</em></center> <br>
<center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-H50QdkNZI/AAAAAAAADrs/P0CpCF8uQy4/s400/IMG_3556.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Making my way back down the track.</em></center> <br>
So that was yesterday's run. I was feeling a bit tired this morning (we worked really late last night) and my legs were definitely not in the mood for hills so I thought I'd cruise along the Sunshine Bay track which starts about a couple of ks from the apartment. It's short, gently undulating and through a nice patch of bush along the lakefront. On the way back I nipped up the beginning of the One Mile Creek track which has a link to the street our apartment is on which meant I didn't have to go back along the road. A bit of a tough climb but at least it's short!

<p>Anyway, here's a few snapshots from along the way (mostly on the way back when it was actually light enough for my camera to see anything)...</p>

<em>Looking back towards the Remarkables from Sunshine Bay...yep, the sun is still trying to make it's way up into the sky. It's going to be another awesome day (I must have brought the good weather down with me!).</em></center> <br>

<span><span> <br>
Hello!!</span></span></p>

<p>In the past week I got to hang out in 3 of my favourite places ever as well as having some cool adventures. I had last week off work so on the Monday I cruised up to my mate's farm at Slater Road (one of my favourite places) to help out on the farm, rake some mountain bike tracks in their huge private park and get some biking and kayaking coaching. Paddling up through the mangroves was so awesome especially when we had to bash our way through in parts!</p>

<p>Of course, I can't go up there without going running with Jess so we had our own little adventure on the Tuesday afternoon. It was supposed to be a short run but time seems to melt away in the forest.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HJJ-DCnzI/AAAAAAAADi0/9ARUNZydLOs/s400/IMG_3438.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Here's Jess inside afterwards...the ultimate training companion and boy can she go fast when she wants to!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HJMnNPcPI/AAAAAAAADjA/uh7s7TgE6gY/s400/IMG_3441.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
To prove I am capable of relaxing, the following morning The Chef and I headed off to my beach house at </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Waikauri+Bay,+New+Zealand&amp;sll=-36.618697,174.342384&amp;sspn=0.089832,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=Febk1P0dEGZrCg&amp;split=0&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Waikauri+Bay&amp;z=13"><span><span>Waikauri Bay</span></span></a><span><span> which is quite possibly my favourite place in the whole world. I have many awesome memories of endless summers playing in the waves and exploring the hills. Pretty much all we did was eat, read, wander along the beach and round the rocks and laze about.

<p>Anyway, on the drive up we stopped off at the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.matakanavillage.co.nz/stores/black_dog_cafe.php"><span><span>Black Dog Cafe</span></span></a><span><span> in Matakana for lunch. I got this warmed roast vegetable salad which was really nice but not exactly filling.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9sdVBwPI/AAAAAAAADjs/HFrPFBURm0Q/s400/IMG_3444.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dinner more than made up for a light lunch (although we did demolish a packet of pita crisps) with tofu sausages topped with fried onion and mushrooms alongside steamed broccoli and kumara chips. I think I ate my weight in kumara chips that night!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9tl6kTdI/AAAAAAAADjw/kTd6L5bq42E/s400/IMG_3446.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The following morning we ate the leftover kumara chips covered in maple syrup. I had no idea this would be such a good combination but I am definitely going to have it again soon!

<p>I had leftover waffle mixture in my freezer from the dessert party so brought that up with us for breakfast the next day. While I was in charge of the waffles, The Chef cooked up some caramelised apple and feijoas in maple syrup.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9vGBlB2I/AAAAAAAADj0/ab444KnN-gM/s400/IMG_3447.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Throughout the course of the day we managed to polish off over a kilogram of feijoas. Well, the bag had to be finished so it was up to us to eat them all! I love feijoa season!

<p>Lunch of champions...falafel, fresh bread with hummus and a mega salad.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9wK8EjkI/AAAAAAAADj4/HvtjnRWoUXA/s400/IMG_3450.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The Chef thought he'd eat his portion as a sandwich. Um, yeah...watching him try to wrap his mouth around this mammoth monster was hilarious!

<p>But I can never relax for too long and Thursday night I was off to the airport and flying down South to Otago for the National Orienteering Champs. This is my first year running in the elite grade for all races so I was pretty excited...but pretty nervous.</p>

<p>The first race was the sprint event in </p></span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=roxburgh,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-36.866443,174.772559&amp;sspn=0.044771,0.066347&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Roxburgh,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=13"><span><span>Roxburgh</span></span></a><span><span>. Ah, not my finest moment after a bad route choice ending up in thick scrub down a valley. But I did pull out some good splits for the last few controls which was good since you were visible to all the spectators on the hill for that final section!</span></span><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p92FvePPI/AAAAAAAADkA/YlfF86zPP8U/s400/IMG_3453.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The second day was the middle distance event in </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Bannockburn,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.539919,169.313904&amp;sspn=0.078392,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Bannockburn,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=12"><span><span>Bannockburn</span></span></a><span><span> which was just out of Cromwell. Heaps of cliffs, some killer climbs and more scrub for me to get caught in!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p93EgmJ0I/AAAAAAAADkE/VNan3deU9-0/s400/IMG_3456.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The long distance event was just out of Alexandra at </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Earnscleugh,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.089691,169.161136&amp;sspn=0.158035,0.265388&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Earnscleugh,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=13"><span><span>Earnscleugh Station</span></span></a><span><span> and it was bitterly cold, very exposed, quite steep, very rocky, extremely fast terrain and (for us running the elite women's grade) a very long course. Oh, and a nasty barbed wire, outrigger fence. Below is the final stretch to the finish and boy was I glad to make it that far!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p94Ybg9cI/AAAAAAAADkI/IpCQCtFRhXw/s400/IMG_3461.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'm not normally a fan of the relay event 'cause it always feels like so much pressure...if you stuff up or manage to mispunch or something then you let your whole team down but I was so looking forward to this one 'cause it was being held in </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Naseby,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.21606,169.310859&amp;sspn=0.078843,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Naseby,+New+Zealand&amp;z=11"><span><span>Naesby</span></span></a><span><span> which is another very special place to me. Oh, and I was in an awesome relay team with a couple of great mates out to have fun. We decided not to take it too seriously and wore our race numbers sideways just to be a bit different.

Here's the start of the relay which is always chaos. Lucky I was second-leg runner.</span></span><div><span style="font-family:verdana, serif;"><span> <br>

I was even awesome enough to cook my own beans for once! About time since Mum had given me a bag of dried organic kidney beans for Christmas and they've been sitting in the pantry ever since.

<p>On the Saturday I competed in </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thedual.co.nz/"><span><span>The Dual</span></span></a><span><span> off-road half marathon which (for anyone who knows the area) goes from </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=home+bay,+motutapu,+New+Zealand&amp;sll=-36.774986,174.934702&amp;sspn=0.022412,0.033174&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Home+Bay&amp;ll=-36.76983,174.897366&amp;spn=0.089656,0.198097&amp;z=13"><span><span>Home Bay</span></span></a><span><span> on Motutapu Island to Rangitoto Island and then back again with lots of big hills and epic rock sections.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HK9SRjp2I/AAAAAAAADjU/DdJoPxRzzDI/s400/IMG_3422.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Above is Home Bay and the final part of the hill you come tearing down (well, sort of since your legs feel a bit like jelly about now and my feet were killing me after the hellish rock sections).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HK-ZL0cxI/AAAAAAAADjY/1_QvneJSmWg/s400/IMG_3426.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is Rangitoto Island from the ferry on the way home again. Rangitoto is the most recent volcanic cone in Auckland (there are something like 49 volcanic areas in the region) and the biggest. It's surface is all rough scoria rock with native bush somehow growing amongst it all. You run almost to the top before descending down a narrow, rocky track that flattens out at the bottom and winds around the edge of the island (for a grueling 6km) before heading back up and over Motutapu again to the finish.

<p>This was my second time competing in this race and it went a whole lot better than last year! I was a bit more prepared for the section of hell (I think I passed at least 20 people somewhere amongst all that rock) and had an awesome run managing to get in the top 10 women despite still having a lingering cold and taking it easy. I guess it helps that I like hills and uneven terrain.</p>

<p>And because obviously I felt like I hadn't run up enough hills, on the Sunday we had orienteering out on one of the steepest maps we have in our area!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HK_A-cJJI/AAAAAAAADjc/415trsyIkfI/s400/IMG_3430.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Quite spectacular and I almost wished I'd taken my camera out on the course (this is the view from the event centre.

<p>Anyway, now I've bored you completely with sport we can return to food! I met my darling cousin D for lunch on Friday and after dithering all morning about where I wanted to eat we decided to go to Raw Power.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HKZTWwStI/AAAAAAAADjM/AC1Nxl-MoQc/s400/IMG_3417.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I wasn't feeling all that hungry so got a salad from the salad bar. They have a collection of different salads to pick from and you basically just fill up your bowl with what ever you want. Clearly I overdosed a little on the peanuts but it was delicious all the same, especially the pearl barley salad (which I think you can just see poking out on the left).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HKaV2T4WI/AAAAAAAADjQ/aBO92JBt_hM/s400/IMG_3418.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
D got me a melting moment cookie too which was sitting there tempting me the whole time I was eating my salad so it had to be devoured straight away! SO good (but a little rich...sometimes I wonder what is happening to my tastebuds these days!).

<p>Right, I have to race off and start packing for another adventure!</p></span></span>

            <h1><a href="../../../../the_dual_half_marathon/">The DUAL Half Marathon</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>You have 4 options with <a href="http://">The DUAL</a> - you can do the 50km or 30km mountain bike races, the marathon or the half marathon and, obviously, I chose to do the half marathon. Again. You see, I did this race last year as well (although it had a slightly different start last time).</p>

<p>Just for an overview, here's the course profile with a total of 553 metres climb. Yep, pretty much as soon as you start you're heading straight up. There's no easing you into it!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S8ZuJywHyGI/AAAAAAAADmM/W4fG3sev2-U/s400/dualprofile.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Below is the course map for the race (click on the map to see it larger). Most of the sections on Rangitoto were on those narrow rocky tracks (scoria) so it's pretty lethal and you have to keep your wits about you at all times. The worst section starts around about the 12km mark and goes until you reach the causeway between the two islands. It's brutal.

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/lB7jPgv81oTduRknAMVH-2r_bpZ6UUXVqDbhjocKz8U?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S8ZuLA_6tYI/AAAAAAAADmQ/2lVVfC_GTD0/s400/dualmap.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
I was still feeling a bit sick and really wasn't feeling like doing this race to be honest. Last year I'd had a terrible race and I really wanted to redo it to what I knew I was capable of. So I set a goal of a time to beat and entered again. But then I got asked to be in a team for the ARC race the weekend before and all training got focused into that so the last time I'd done a long run was nearly 6 weeks beforehand so I'd given up on my goal and decided just finishing it would be nice (get it over and done with!).

<p>Sitting on the ferry to get to the event I was feeling pretty relaxed and prepared to chill out and walk and enjoy the scenery if I began to feel too sick (I was still feeling pretty gluggy in the throat when I ran). By this stage I couldn't care less! But from what I learnt last year, don't place yourself too far back in the field especially when the course starts with a hill 'cause passing people is frustrating. So I stood about 2 or 3 rows from the back (next to the eventual female winner as it turns out) which felt about right. No one set off that fast to be honest and I had to pass a few people as we reached the hill but I was taking it pretty easy and picked a girl just ahead of me to keep pace with. She was going a little slower than my natural speed but I wasn't in any hurry. I dropped her on the way down Motutapu anyway.</p>

<p>I picked up another guy at the base of Rangitoto amongst a pack of about 15 of us and kept with him until he slowed down about halfway up so I dropped him. People were starting to walk around me and I ended up in the front of this pack (it's funny watching people come tearing past you and then they slow right down not long after and you just plod on past). I remembered it was quite important to get in front of people before the rocky downhill section began so I didn't get trapped (as offroad is my strength). It was also going to be important to remember the worst section was still to come and to take it easy. I passed a few people on the way down hill and a couple of fast guys passed me (which was the last time anyone passed me apart from 2 guys sprinting on the way down to the finish which I passed on the way up the hill anyway).</p>

<p>Once nearly reaching the bottom I cracked open my chocolate powerbar gel and made myself have half of it (all whilst still running - I tucked the other half in my back pocket and washed it down with heaps of my electrolyte drink in my camelbak. This was all in preparation of the killer section. It wasn't long before I could feel it kicking in...they are awesome (as far as gels go).</p>

<p>The next section (it's around about 6km along the edge of Rangitoto on rough volcanic rock. No hills, just undulation and a hell of a lot of rock hopping) was where everything went wrong last year. I just died totally which was so frustrating because rock should have been my strength over the other runners. This year though I was wearing my awesome <a href="http://inov-8.com/Products-Detail.asp?PG=PG1&amp;L=26&amp;P=5050973033">Inov-8 Flyroc 310</a>s (mine are the old school version though with the hideous fluoro green inside) and I knew this section was the toughest so I was prepared. So prepared in fact that I passed over 20 people in this section (including the last female I ever saw out there at around the 14km mark). I just kept myself running, knowing that if I stopped there was not much chance of getting started again. If I tripped then I slowed down a little and drunk some more. The shoes were great and I never felt in danger of my ankles going under plus they grip to the rocks with ease which gives you a lot of confidence in your footing!</p>

<p>Once I'd got off the rock I forced down the last half of the powerbar gel in preparation for the final killer hill. Going back up Motutapu is definitely the hardest of the climbs. Rangitoto might be nearly twice as high but this hill keeps lulling you into thinking you've reached the top...but then there'll be another small uphill, and another, and another...until you wonder if you'll ever get there. By now there were definitely people walking and I could see them ahead of me. I was determined to keep running, no matter how slow. This ended up letting me pass at least another 5 or 6 guys which was cool.</p>

<em>Looking pretty cheerful and fresh for the 19km mark!</em></center> <br>
Once you do actually reach the top of the final incline though, the view is amazing and in that moment I wished I'd had my camera. I also felt a little teary 'cause I'd actually found myself totally enjoying the race (that smile in the photo above is all genuine believe it or not).

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HK9SRjp2I/AAAAAAAADjU/DdJoPxRzzDI/s400/IMG_3422.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>The hill down to the finish at Home Bay.</em></center> <br>
Then you're on your way down and feeling the pain in your feet (boy does the rock section hurt your feet) and it's all about staying upright. That hill goes on and on and you hit the final flat sprint section (maybe 200 metres?) at quite a speed. I was impressed with my sprint finish (and so was the guy just behind me who congratulated me once we'd both crossed the line)!

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S8Pj_o5_LhI/AAAAAAAADmA/Lh4A56VwxHc/s400/thedual10_02971.jpg" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Look at the determination as I cross the line!</em></center> <br>
I finished in a time of 2 hours 22 minutes and 43 seconds which was just over 20 minutes faster than last year! I'm kind of interested in what kind of time I could have achieved had I not still felt sick, had a good night's sleep instead of staying up way too late and getting about 4 hours and, well, actually tried to get a good time. That's not to say I wasn't knackered at the end of the race but I definitely wasn't pushing it at any stage so I was thrilled with my time.

<p>I don't think I want to do this race again in a hurry as twice is really enough (I can always head over to the island to run it again by myself anyway) but it's made me think a lot more about some of the other offroad races I've been wanting to do and how I am more than capable of doing quite well. I think so much of it comes down to the attitude I set out with. I definitely perform better when I'm more relaxed about it.</p>
