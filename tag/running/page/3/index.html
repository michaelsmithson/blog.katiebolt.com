Life is amazing. Hell, even when it's tough it's still pretty amazing. Here are some cool things and great food in my life recently...</span></span></p>

<p>Ginger crunch.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGPBqVJhsGI/AAAAAAAAEEU/yF-Ys4fYC-8/s400/IMG_4000.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Even better is getting home from a long day at work to find a parcel sitting outside my bedroom door...a parcel containing my favourite ginger crunch all the way from <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/search?q=soul+food">Soul Food</a> in Christchurch. Awesome!

<p>Riding my bikes.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THc7rq-axtI/AAAAAAAAEN0/uBfD6lrJx5M/s400/IMG_4108.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is my new road bike (I've called her Ellie...interesting to note that my mountain bike is definitely male in my eyes but my road bike is a female)!!! She's shiny and fast!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THc7aE8SjkI/AAAAAAAAENg/79U8L5CQ8X4/s400/IMG_3163.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here's my mountain bike. He's strong and dependable...and is about to go on his first overseas adventure! I will admit there were times in the past when I was quite ready to throw him off the top of a cliff but these days we are quite good mates!

<p>Hot soup on a cold day.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoacUub-MI/AAAAAAAAD-s/gsFHsZFwCYs/s400/IMG_3830.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is one of the many vegan soups (Tuscan bean and vegetable to be exact) from the coffee shop across the road, </span></span><a href="http://www.viewauckland.co.nz/restaurants/agnes-curran-info-56668.html"><span><span>Agnes Curran</span></span></a><span><span>. They make all their soups and are now consciously thinking about the ingredients they use and let me know when they're vegan. Plus the staff there always make me laugh (I don't drink coffee but my boss does and I'm the one to go get it...they know me very well!).

<p></p></span></span><a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/2010/07/running-at-tawharanui.html"><span><span>Running at Tawharanui</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TEY89BO3v3I/AAAAAAAAD9M/9a_0WwtcMpo/s400/100710_130007.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Waikauri Bay is my favourite place and over the hill is </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/tawharanui/"><span><span>Tawharanui Regional Park</span></span></a><span><span> which I've been exploring all my life. Running over there never gets old. Even better is sharing the experience with a friend and we even had beautiful weather...in the middle of winter!

<p>Chocolate (I mean, how could it not be part of an awesome life)!!!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj564VMSI/AAAAAAAAEBo/WKA-ihp30Bk/s400/IMG_3975.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
That (above) is a Decadent Date from </span></span><a href="http://www.shechocolat.com/"><span><span>She Chocolat</span></span></a><span><span> in Christchurch (D bought me a whole bag as a present). It's described as a fresh organic medjool date hand stuffed with a gianduja filling and coated in the finest Belgian chocolate. Delicious!

<p>New running shoes (I don't know how fond I am of the bright pink colour of my new </p></span></span><a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/p/Womens/11/Mizuno_Ladies_Wave_Nirvana_6_Shoes/5360049181/"><span><span>Mizunos</span></span></a><span><span> though but I love <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/">Wiggle</a>!). Even better is getting new off road shoes and wearing them in (because I can't handle them being clean for long)! Below are my new </span></span><a href="http://www.inov-8.com/"><span><span>Inov-8</span></span></a><span><span> Roclite 285s 'cause my old ones are starting the slow trip to falling apart.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THw04kLATHI/AAAAAAAAEOM/ZzQwtu4lDMs/s400/IMG_4140.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The only thing that makes that experience even cooler is testing them out in the </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/waitakere-ranges/"><span><span>Waitakere Ranges</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THw06ASEEEI/AAAAAAAAEOQ/zPDfEhhYPHA/s400/IMG_4141.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It is like paradise (but the weather is very temperamental out there so I'm always weary of taking my camera out with me...maybe next time).

<p>Eating lunch with A at </p></span></span><a href="http://www.kokako.co.nz/"><span><span>Kokako</span></span></a><span><span> and catching up on all the gossip and drama of his life...makes for a truly entertaining experience! It's just along from my gym so A is a bit of a celebrity whenever we go too!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TDKkm3GE8FI/AAAAAAAAD4s/8OTxJjg5Foo/s400/IMG_3719.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Plus the food there is good. Above we have the tofu scramble with their awesome veggie booster juice and below is the beans on toast (which isn't really beans on toast at all since they put the beans </span></span><em><span><span>next</span></span></em><span><span> to the toast but I can forgive them!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGPBlsLIbnI/AAAAAAAAEEE/5NAG8FCtyOU/s400/IMG_3981.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
As I was writing this I realised it could actually go on and on which is incredibly heartening!

<p>But one of the best things? Awesome friends coming to visit...I'm counting down the hours till I head out to the airport tonight!</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
...which can also be known as Monday in Christchurch.</span></span></p>

<p>Leaving Christchurch is always hard. When I come home I find that I end up feeling quite lonely and sad.</p>

<p>But before I had to leave I met up with my friend M and we went for a little run in the mud and the drizzle around <a href="http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/parkswalkways/popularparks/halswellquarrypark.aspx"><span><span>Halswell Quarry</span></span></a><span><span> with the aid of an orienteering map (and perhaps we may have ventured on to some private land but what no one saw, no one knows about right?).</span></span></p>

<p>Running, of course, makes you feel a bit hungry so we ventured into town for a spot of lunch at my favourite cafe, <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews.php?id=7315"><span><span>Soul Food</span></span></a><span><span>. M is quite indecisive and I want everything so we decided to get the vegan BLT (which is extremely yummy...probably the vegan aioli that really does it for me)...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokDuZHoII/AAAAAAAAECA/v41hJstfkX0/s400/IMG_3959.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and the vegan lentil and brown rice burger (which is very filling and healthy-tasting although not in a bad way in case you were of the opinion that healthy-tasting and delicious couldn't go hand in hand)...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokCDxLNXI/AAAAAAAAEB8/7QiHw8wuC6o/s400/IMG_3961.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and split them. It was a good decision.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokAVKIpeI/AAAAAAAAEB4/iMzf83q9Edg/s400/IMG_3963.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They also have 2 sweet vegan options. The first one is the fruit muffin which is really soft and delicious and the creamy stuff on the top is very nice.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj-oh1rkI/AAAAAAAAEB0/I62m_V9QG7A/s400/IMG_3964.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The second is the ginger crunch which I had on Thursday night as well at </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?client=safari&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=govinda%27s+christchurch&amp;fb=1&amp;hq=govinda%27s&amp;hnear=christchurch&amp;cid=2322395347369035221"><span><span>Govinda's</span></span></a><span><span>. Soul Food and Govinda's are actually run by the same people which is fortunate because that means you have 2 separate places you can get this most awesome ginger crunch. But as I said on a previous post, I am doing my best to replicate it!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj8tLZbfI/AAAAAAAAEBw/rpyqtj5Pz7A/s400/IMG_3966.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Again, so that neither of us got jealous, we split both choices but the ginger crunch bet the muffin hands down. There really was no contest.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj7VLmrsI/AAAAAAAAEBs/55AElwfU8bY/s400/IMG_3968.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And then it was time to go home which was very sad. But it's okay because I will be back down that way very soon (and thank god for skype, email and all that jazz)!</span></span>

Saturday was rock climbing at The Roxx. I would have liked to climb outside again but it was really a bit too cold for that. But the textured wall here is awesome. We don't really have anything like that at Extreme Edge up in Auckland.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGR2dTVUoaI/AAAAAAAAEFk/mtjN64S_sg4/s400/IMG_3898.JPG" alt="" title="">

Then Sunday was some club orienteering at South Brighton domain. I had 2 shocker runs (a 180 on such an easy course is really quite embarrassing!) but it was all good fun and I love orienteering. Plus it's always good to hang out with the PAPO guys.

<p>And finally on Monday Michael took me out running at Halswell Quarry which was quite nice. It was a bit overcast and drizzly for any photos though but it's pretty cool especially when you're at the top of the quarry looking down. Would be nice to have more people to run with in Auckland...perhaps I should move to Christchurch!</p>

            <p></p><p>I'd heard of this <a href="http://www.toughguyandgal.co.nz/">race</a> many times but never entered before. The original race takes place in Rotorua but it's become so popular that they now have events in Auckland and Palmerston North as well. A few of my friends from mountain biking convinced me to give the Auckland event a go and I'm always up for the challenge. This year's event took place at the Woodhill Sands Equestrian Centre about 45 minutes north (west) of Auckland.</p>

<p>The full race is 12kms (2 laps of a 6km course...there is a 6km option) and is, according to the website, based on an "army type obstacle course". You can run, walk, push, crawl or climb through a variety of natural and man made obstacles. Apparently the maximum depth of water at any stage is approximately waist deep...as you will read later on, this was not quite true by the time it came to my second lap! Basically it involves a whole lot of mud, barbed wire, bush and paddock sections, hurdles (it's run out of an equestrian centre) and swamp crossings.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TE9nlVjhnuI/AAAAAAAAD9s/sjAkGBIaJFY/s400/tgg110_01513.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
I started about three-quarters of the way back with my friends which turned out to not be the smartest idea as I spent all of the first lap trying to get past people. There were so many people anxious about jumping into the swamps and people walking up hills blocking the way which made me lose a bit of momentum. I got swamped by one guy when I was in one of the mud pools and he jumped in next to me. It felt like a tidal wave going over my head!

The second lap was better as it was really spread out by then and I passed a few more people. All was going well until we caught up with the 6km guys (they started 10 minutes after us) who were picking their way over everything. Luckily they were pretty good at getting out of the way and yelled encouragement...one of the bonuses of being female near the front of the pack as you get heaps of support.

I was ahead of a couple of girls until right near the end when I got stuck behind a gridlock of 6km people and I took a stupid decision to jump into the stream (it was neck deep by this point). It was bloody hard to get myself out again! The other girls managed to get through the gridlock and went round and got ahead. I managed a good sprint finish to get within a few seconds of them but I would have been 3rd if I'd done what they did but had to settle for 5th. Damn!

I finished in just over an hour and 9 minutes which isn't too bad a k rate for mud, swamps, obstacles and sections of crawling under barbed wire! My verdict? Heaps of fun but not really that tough to be honest. I'll have to try the event at it's home (Rotorua) next year.
