I am SO tired! Yesterday we had a fun 3 hour night </span></span><a href="http://www.rogaining.com/"><span><span>rogaine</span></span></a><span><span> event round some of the local streets and I didn't get back from that until pretty late and then I got up for spin this morning. I'm very much in need of a nap right about now.</span></span></p>

<p>Here's my epic breakfast...a super thick banana smoothie (frozen banana, frozen berries, ground flaxseed, tahini, cocoa and oat milk) topped with muesli and chopped almonds and walnuts. SO good.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrxFvI0QmRI/AAAAAAAAC3o/oevg8swImLU/s400/IMG_2743.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, after my superpowered breakfast I had to race into town to meet Mum to go check out the </span></span><a href="http://www.ritaangus.com/"><span><span>Rita Angus</span></span></a><span><span> (a well-known New Zealand artist) exhibition at the </span></span><a href="http://www.aucklandartgallery.govt.nz/"><span><span>Auckland City Art Gallery</span></span></a><span><span>. After wandering round the display for about 2 hours (and debating which were our favourites and where we would hang them if we owned them!) we were famished and in need of lunch.

<p>Revel delivered with both of us ordering the Vegan Reveller.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrxFwF66OWI/AAAAAAAAC3s/UaDcNzqDG7c/s400/IMG_2747.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
How can you possibly go wrong with a huge plate of giant falafels with grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, hummus, sundried tomato and basil pestos all served with lightly toasted bread?

<p>Despite being so full after all this food that we could hardly move, dessert had to be ordered so we grabbed a couple of slices of the Peanut Butter Cake/Pie/whatever to take away and managed to wander down to Albert Park to indulge.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrxFw9IAtqI/AAAAAAAAC3w/wxIic3OvQqs/s400/IMG_2750.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is what all Fridays should be made of (in case you were wondering, that's two slices of cake/pie and no, unfortunately I didn't get to eat them both as I had to share with Mum!).</span></span>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>There was nothing I could do. There were no precautions I could take. There was no place I could hide. There was no one who could help me. <br>

<span><span> <br>
It's probably just me but I thought you might be interested in what a "normal" weekday looks like for me. Every day is quite different but you get the general idea...</span></span></p>

<p>So the alarm on my phone goes off at 5:10am...welcome to Monday morning. I drag on my gym gear...laid out on the chair the night before so I don't have to use my brain. I try and drink as much water as I can manage and eat one of <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/09/fueling-up.html"><span><span>these</span></span></a><span><span>...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdpOFnnwI/AAAAAAAACxY/K7QEO6xYgq4/s400/IMG_2640.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Off to the </span></span><a href="http://www.olympicpools.co.nz/"><span><span>gym</span></span></a><span><span>! There is a queue of us completely insane people waiting outside for opening time at 5:45am. We file in, dump our gear in the lockers and head upstairs and across the bridge over the pool into the gym where I head to the peleton room and claim a bike (this is why I'm here so early...bikes go pretty fast especially as the weather improves...don't know why that is!). Spin class starts at 6:05am and is a 45 minute torture session taken by my friend L. After class I head over to the floor to finish up with some core exercises and stretches.

<p>Time to hit the showers. I only wash my hair once a week (okay, so I rinse it if it gets too icky from sport but that's it) and Monday is the day...the gym showers are great and I don't feel quite so bad about taking too long. Because I have a really sensitive scalp I use </p></span></span><a href="http://www.purist.com/product.php?product=24"><span><span>this shampoo</span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="http://www.purist.com/product.php?product=36"><span><span>this conditioner</span></span></a><span><span>. These don't make my hair as soft and silky as other products I've tried but they don't make my scalp feel like it's erupting which is rather more important!

<p>It's then off to work where I'll have breakfast at my desk. Yesterday it was a spelt muffin and fruit but sometimes I'll have toast with almond butter and jam. If I'm at home for breakfast it's normally weetbix, fruit and rice milk.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdqJWOXLI/AAAAAAAACxc/tRAn8YJOZaU/s400/IMG_2642.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>Did I really just take a photo of fruit? Not very exciting...well, as a photo anyway!</span></span></em></center><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdrK9eu1I/AAAAAAAACxg/2UXoPZf6XRU/s400/IMG_2645.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Work comes and goes but no doubt I'll spend a bit too much time having email conversations with a couple of my friends as I count down till lunchtime!

<p>Lunchtime has been leftovers lately which is awesome. When I'm cooking dinner I'll often try to make extra 'cause I don't want to have to buy lunch (for a start there aren't that many options near my office).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdsHgDQOI/AAAAAAAACxk/Df7_OZAY0oU/s400/IMG_2646.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yesterday was leftover Pumpkin and Kumara Soup from the freezer mixed with leftover veges and tofu from another night - a double-whammy of leftovers!

<p>Often Monday nights are quiet but last night I was climbing with my brother and his friend at </p></span></span><a href="http://extremeedge.co.nz/"><span><span>Extreme Edge</span></span></a><span><span>. We usually climb together about once a week but the night is always different to fit in with everyone's schedules. We are looking at doing a lead climbing course soon which is pretty much freaking me out.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVxIYItdaI/AAAAAAAACys/abyDqSqMEN0/s400/IMG_2658.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVxGwhHCsI/AAAAAAAACyo/YLi42bd8iUs/s400/IMG_2663.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>My brother really wanted his arse to feature on this blog so here it is, just for you darling bro!</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, before climbing I will normally snack on a muesli bar of some sort. Last night it was a Cool Mint Chocolate </span></span><a href="http://www.clifbar.com/"><span><span>Clif Bar</span></span></a><span><span>, my favourite.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVui6dTmsI/AAAAAAAACyc/XlWXWudPhSY/s400/IMG_2647.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>I just noticed that there is a picture of a climber on the clif bar packet...how appropriate!</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
By the time I get home I'll no doubt be exhausted as I always fail in my resolution to go to bed early on a Sunday night so very little sleep will have been had! I'll also undoubtably be hungry (if we haven't gone to get </span></span><a href="https://hellpizza.co.nz/"><span><span>Hell Pizza</span></span></a><span><span> after climbing). Last night I was too lazy to do anything so I had nut butter and jam on toast! Terrible I know but it was after 9pm when I got home and sometimes you just can't be bothered.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVuk3mETPI/AAAAAAAACyk/HGIMyiw_Qls/s400/IMG_2671.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is actually a photo of a previous breakfast but I forgot to take a photo of my dinner...but they looked exactly the same! I also discovered I had a bliss ball in the fridge from </span></span><a href="http://www.thebluebird.co.nz/"><span><span>The Blue Bird</span></span></a><span><span> so I snacked on that too. Yummy!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVuj2u00YI/AAAAAAAACyg/gB9ikWGfTxo/s400/IMG_2669.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'll then pack my bags and organise my gear and in the fridge I'll put all my breakfast and lunch food for the next day in a bag ready for me to grab as I race out the door. Then I can finally drop into bed (always aiming for 10pm but not always succeeding!) and look forward to doing it all again in the morning!

<p>Hmmmm, this seems to make my life seem somewhat boring but actually it's pretty cool (well, I think so anyway) and hopelessly busy (</p></span></span><a href="https://www.google.com/calendar"><span><span>Google Calendar</span></span></a><span><span> saves my life). I often wonder how I'm going to make it to the end of the week without dropping from exhaustion but I always do and am always ready and waiting for the week to start again come Sunday night!</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span><span style="font-size:x-small;">Here in the trees it was much easier to believe the absurdities that embarrassed me indoors. Nothing had changed in this forest for thousands of years, and all the myths and legends of a hundred different lands seemed much more likely in this green haze than they had in my clear-cut bedroom. <br>

<p>I'm feeling a little jaded this afternoon. Tomorrow night is our family Christmas party so I've spent pretty much all of today in the kitchen preparing some of the food for the evening...but you'll have to wait until next time to find out what's on the menu! Of course, before ending up in the kitchen we got up not long after 5am for the final spin class of the year complete with champagne and strawberries! Then it was home to have breakfast of last night's tofu scramble. What a way to start the day!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SUsjhWmjCpI/AAAAAAAABps/j5Vr75LyBxw/s400/IMG_1174.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><div><div style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-style: italic; "><span><span>This is actually last night's dinner but hey, breakfast looked pretty much identical so deal with it.</span></span></span><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span>Anyway, on to more exciting things. Last Friday I got to meet Theresa from </span></span><a href="http://travelingvegan.blogspot.com/"><span><span>The Tropical Vegan</span></span></a><span><span> for lunch as she was visiting Auckland for a conference! Being my usual self I was a nervous as anything but, as usual, there was nothing to worry about!</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span>Meeting up in town meant the obvious place to go check out was Raw Power. Theresa ordered the Tofu Burger which I've talked about </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/05/in-honour-of-coldplay.html"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>. Despite being a fairly warm day, I had a craving for soup (needing comforting perhaps?!) so got their soup of the day, Curried Vegetable Soup served with focaccia bread and hummus. It was creamy and delicious. Washed down with one of their freshly made juices, it hit the spot perfectly.</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SUVhNQw66GI/AAAAAAAABf8/1SDbF3ZbyYI/s400/IMG_1160.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span>Since you can't really go past dessert if it's offered I got a Caramel and Date slice (or at least that's what I think it was but I couldn't even remember by the time I'd decided what I'd wanted let alone now, a few days later!). We took our treats to enjoy in the sun (you have to make the most of it round here sometimes!) in Albert Park across the road from the university.</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SUVhMUhp7-I/AAAAAAAABf0/K2OrwQ217fI/s400/IMG_1161.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span><span>That evening we drove up to our family beach house at Wai Kauri Bay to escape for the weekend and enjoy the fine weather. As usual we had to check out the </span></span><a href="http://www.matakanavillage.co.nz/farmmkt01.htm"><span><span>Matakana Farmer's Market</span></span></a><span><span> on Saturday morning which included an On Yer Bike chocolate smoothie which you were supposed to blend yourself by riding this stationary bike attached to the blender. Unfortunately no amount of pedaling was getting my smoothie blended...I must have broke it!</span></span></div><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><div><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SUVhIu53sJI/AAAAAAAABfo/lTUu-tJstls/s400/IMG_1166.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><span><span>In the afternoon we took our bikes over to </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/tawharanui/"><span><span>Tawharanui Regional Park</span></span></a><span><span> for a bit of adventuring (and a bit of scaring of the farm animals as we came flying past). We got some awesome views at the end of the peninsula looking all the way out to </span></span><a href="http://www.littlebarrierisland.org.nz/"><span><span>Little Barrier Island</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SUVhUZIFKRI/AAAAAAAABgE/d3i2TKVPpW4/s400/IMGP2309.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span></div><span><span>It may be summer now but that doesn't mean the water is warm and inviting for swimming but hey, all you gotta do is toughen up right? Anyway, after all the mountain biking in the hot sun, a little cold water never hurt anyone!

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size:x-small;">This is a secret: sometimes I am glad when Henry is gone. Sometimes I enjoy being alone. Sometimes I walk through the house late at night and I shiver with the pleasure of not talking, not touching, just walking, or sitting, or taking a bath. Sometimes I lie on the living room floor and listen to Fleetwood Mac, the Bangles, the B-52’s, the Eagles, bands Henry can’t stand. Sometimes I go for long walks with Alba and I don’t leave a note saying where I am. <br>
- Claire from <em>The Time Traveler's Wife</em> by Audrey Niffenegger</span></p>

<p>I finally finished reading <em>The Time Traveler's Wife</em> by Audrey Niffenegger late last night. It had me up late desperately clinging to the pages of the book as I moved closer to the inevitable end. It’s been a long time since I’ve managed to get engrossed in a book, and even longer since I’ve been moved so deeply by the words on a page. There is something about the characters in this book which touched me deeply. I felt their pain, their loss, their fear, their loneliness. But I also felt their love, their passion, their hope, their beauty. But I was oddly disturbed this morning to discover that the book is being made into a film...</p>

<p>So I didn’t get much sleep after finishing the book as I had to leave the house just after 5am this morning to get to spin class. I was thinking about the madness of spin (Peloton) class the other day. You have to get there for the gym opening at 5.45am in order to claim a bike in time for the class which starts at 6:05am. So when I’m staying at my parents then, well, I have to leave just after 5am. Madness! Plus the class itself is crazy. Crammed into a tiny, darkened room filled with about 30 of these stationary bikes we gasp for air, sweating like anything despite (or perhaps because of) the tiny open windows and 2 fans going at full throttle. Our instructor sits up the front on his bike barking out orders (his microphone has been broken the last couple of times) and instructing us to “add more dial” (read: increase resistance and therefore pain) and to “pick up that cadence” (read: speed up that peddling). He has to shout to be heard above the thumping music blasting out of the stereo even when he’s got a microphone. All the while we are grabbing at our towels to wipe the sweat away and cursing the discomfort of those bloody bike seats (and I’m trying to work out how many more tracks until it’s over!). We battle our own imaginary hills and sprint race against invisible opponents as if it’s life or death. So why do I keep coming back? It’s bloody addictive, that’s why!</p>
