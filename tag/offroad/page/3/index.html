        <section class="">
            <p></p><p><a href="http://www.orienteeringauckland.org.nz/summernav/">SummerNav</a> is a series of orienteering events held once a  week after work during the summer at various parks in the Auckland region. It's one of my favourite things about summer. Is that sad?!</p>

<p>I missed the first event at the Auckland Domain as I was still nursing my foot injury but thought I'd tackle the next event at <a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/hamlins-hill-mutukaroa/">Hamlins Hill</a>. On Monday night I'd gone for my first run in 6 weeks, all of 10 minutes, and the foot seemed okay but I wasn't going to push my luck since I had an 8-hour rogaine in the weekend so opted for course 2 instead of the usual course 1.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/O05lG-8tm4AjdsKSWhu-ZCkT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoSHue449I/AAAAAAAAEi4/K4xUOkJpv0E/s400/SS%20-%20Hamlins%20Hill.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
The ground is really rutted since it has cattle in it so it's real 'ankle breaking' stuff so running was tough and my foot wasn't too impressed. I tried to make sure that when I climbed the fences I landed on my right foot instead but it was weird because my normal climbing method involves me jumping down onto my left foot so I felt a bit unco. It was so cool to be out there running and orienteering again (orienteering on the mountain bike feels quite different) but I wasn't concentrating and made heaps of silly mistakes which is embarrassing because it was super easy navigation!

<p>I thought I did terribly, feeling slow and orienteering SO badly (I was constantly worrying about my foot, feeling excited about running again and consequently not thinking about the map at all!), but everyone else must have done worse since I ended up doing quite well in the results!</p>

            <p></p><p>I love the <a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/waitakere-ranges/">Waitakere Ranges</a> and I try to head out there as much as possible. It's an awesome place to run and there is so much I have yet to explore. On Friday, despite the forecast of some horrendous storm, I thought I'd head out for some training and luckily the worst of the rain held back until I finished!</p>

<p>This particular loop is one of my favourites: starting at the bottom of Falls Road you head along Upper Kauri track (up and up and up!) then Sisam, then Chateau Mosquito (and your first river crossing), then RGB (the second river crossing and the track is steep and nasty), then left onto Ridgeline, down Fenceline (you pass one of the reservoir lakes) and then back to the carpark via the Auckland City walk.</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../the_ophir_awesome_e_p_i_c_12_hour_rogaine/">The Ophir Awesome E.P.I.C. 12 Hour Rogaine</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>The Ophir Awesome E.P.I.C. Rogaine was a 12 hour race held out on the Raggedy Range above the small township of Ophir. It's typical Central Otago country with rolling farmland and lots of rocks. Thankfully it was a fairly fine day (slightly overcast and a fairly mild temperature for this time of year) as the area is pretty exposed and could have been pretty miserable in bad weather.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7KsZ5lDrI/AAAAAAAAET8/KxdrvNHmoTI/s400/IMG_4264.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>The event centre - the Ophir Town Hall on the right...I love the quaint old buildings down here</em></center> <br>
As I think I've explained before, with a rogaine you are given a map with all the controls and a certain amount of time (this one was 12 hours) and the aim is to get as many as you can. Controls are worth varying amounts of points (in this, #1-5 were 100 points, the #20s were 20, the #30s were 30 and so on). There are also penalties for every minute or part minute you are late back (it was 10 points for this race). So even if you are 1 second late then you lose points. You have a certain amount of time before the race starts to plan out your possible route although this will change as you go along depending on time. But with a long race you are normally required to hand in what is called a 'flight plan' in case of an emergency and a search party is needed so they have some idea of where you might have gone.

<p>You will also have a list of compulsory gear that you must carry with you. For this race each person needed a fleece or woollen top, long sleeve polypro top, leggings, hat, and gloves, a wind and waterproof jacket and overtrousers, a survival blanket, a whistle and a torch (we carried head torches). As a team we needed a first aid kit and a compass. Then on top of that you will need food and drink for the full 12 hours. There was 1 water stop where we were allowed to fill up a maximum of 1.5 litres per person.</p>

<p>Rogaines are generally done in teams, mostly in teams of 2. I was in a team with Michael who has a mountain of experience in rogaines, especially longer ones such as this. Up until this event, the longest rogaine I'd done was 4 hours which rather pales in comparison with 12!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7KtmepicI/AAAAAAAAEUA/PwcEZA7nGrA/s400/IMG_3435.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>And we're off!</em></center> <br>
We all set out in the usual mad dash with teams mainly heading to either #20 or #50 first. We had planned on going to #50 and watched a few teams going off all over the place. We soon realised they were all going to look at the wrong sets of rocks so snuck off to where we thought it should be and had a good look around. Michael finally found it sneakily and we raced off while everyone else kept looking. Good start! But then we were on our own. No one else seemed to have a route anything like ours which was kind of cool but a little unsettling.

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/nR9OINUpXbLo2pe7KpQoeykT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI2niAK2d4I/AAAAAAAAETo/qJT5m3ULqxM/s400/Ophir%20Rogaine.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
Michael's idea was that we would try and get as many controls on the flattish section first before heading out to the far end of the map so we didn't have to go looking for them in the dark which seemed like a good idea since we could clock up heaps of points quite quickly. Also quite a risky idea because once at the furthest end of the map we would have no real shortcuts back if time wasn't on our side. As far as I could tell, most teams seemed to have the opposite approach, choosing to get controls along the top of the range first then come down and do the flattish controls last.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7KuT-X6hI/AAAAAAAAEUE/4ZegHEj9IrY/s400/IMG_3440.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
We were going pretty well and finding controls pretty quickly and it was cool seeing our control card filling up and I was feeling great physically although trying to keep up with Michael's ginormous stride was tough work!

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7Kv5jtM7I/AAAAAAAAEUI/BSH4wMM2FUg/s400/IMG_3443.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Fairly early on Michael decided we should add an extra loop (we called it the 'extended edition') which turned out to be a good idea but left me feeling a bit anxious about how far we still had to go. At the 4 hour mark we were still only about 2.5km away from the hash house! But our control card was filling up nicely which was encouraging!

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7KxCJRNBI/AAAAAAAAEUQ/AcOUrVZ-HsM/s400/IMG_3446.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Typical Central Otago country - rolling farmland covered in rocks</em></center> <br>
Although this event was using cryptic clues, it was nothing like TWALK where you practically had to do a grid search at every control to find the damn things. These were always in the centre of the circle and the clue pretty much always made sense once you got in the right area. It surprised me to hear other people talk of having a lot of trouble. I guess you needed to be able to navigate and read a map...which I would have thought went without saying?

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7K0JDDSOI/AAAAAAAAEUY/E6Qf3mZ3L3k/s400/IMG_3450.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>There was a control on the rock in the centre of the pool and being the kind soul that I am I let Michael go and get that one for us!</em></center> <br>
At about the 5 hour mark I began to feel really ill in the stomach and I had a headache. I knew I'd been eating and hydrating really well most of the time but I suspect I hadn't started early enough. The next 45 minutes were pretty tough until I could finally get my body to release some gas. I upped the electrolyte content of my water and made sure I was drinking a little bit more often and eventually it went away and I felt back to normal. It was a little freaky though because one moment I was saying I was feeling great and then bam, the next minute I'm incredibly nauseous. Definitely something to watch out for.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7K1z8y7aI/AAAAAAAAEUc/-e8vPyUCh7A/s400/IMG_3456.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>The gorge to #74. Thank goodness we weren't one of the teams trying to find this in the dark</em></center> <br>
We reached the water stop at just over halfway and met Greig and Conal there who had gone the other way. It was a bit of a boost of confidence really as they reckoned we'd have enough time to get out to the end and over the tops. Good news for me as I'd been beginning to feel a little panicked! We fueled up and set off again, bumping into Tim and Tane coming the other way as well. They looked knackered.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7K3C_5jwI/AAAAAAAAEUg/pbn3QqSDHEw/s400/IMG_3460.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
Tiger Hill on the right and control #1, worth 100 points</center> <br>
After that we pretty much saw no one apart from 1 other team briefly. My feet began to hurt and I learnt an interesting tip...if you dry your feet and change your socks you'll get at least another hour out of them before you get back to the same pain point you were at before.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7K5P7l88I/AAAAAAAAEUk/TmiWtT2amwE/s400/IMG_3461.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Climbing Tiger Hill</em></center> <br>
We made it up to the trig at the highest point on the course just before 6pm so it was still daylight but we knew there was only limited time left before it would start to get dark. At this point we still weren't sure just how much of our homeward plan we would be able to complete but were feeling fairly optimistic.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7K6Sz2rXI/AAAAAAAAEUo/ja7V4zZEKUU/s400/IMG_3471.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>The highest point on the Raggedy Range</em></center> <br>
Navigation was going pretty well until #36 where I pointed to a hill in the distance and said something like, "we're going to that hill, right?" and Michael agreed so off we ran...bad mistake! We ended up well off and desperately searching the rocks for the damn control which, of course, never appeared. Eventually Michael realised what we'd done so we trouped off to the correct hill but even then we couldn't find it. But just when we were about to give up we saw it at last! I was feeling a bit disheartened by then because we'd wasted a fair amount of time and darkness had pretty much arrived so it was time for the headlights. The time lost meant we had to reevaluate our plan of attack and cut out a short loop we had planned, instead heading straight across to #89.

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7K78XISrI/AAAAAAAAEUs/hkRGj0EH6E0/s400/IMG_3475.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Not long after it got dark my feet started aching unbearably and my knee injury from a few weeks back decided to flare up so it was an incredibly painful last couple of hours but I was pretty determined that it wasn't going to slow us down too much. But I kind of gave up helping navigate by this point and just focused on keeping on moving.

<p>Somehow we managed to stuff up our route from #73 down to #80 and missed the control altogether. If I'd known how close we were to it I would have made us go back but Michael didn't tell me that until afterwards. Not really sure what went wrong as it looked fairly easy on the map but then again it was downhill and I was having too much trouble with my feet to check the map much!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7K86VJEYI/AAAAAAAAEUw/9QRlP9-gJBc/s400/IMG_3477.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>My awkward shuffle-jog once my feet gave up on me!</em></center> <br>
From #70 we bailed out to the road instead of going to try and find #21. It just wasn't worth the pain. And somehow I got myself running at a cracking pace for the last 1.5km or so which surprised me! I guess Michael encouraging me that we could overtake the team in front kind of spurred me on as well as the fact that running was a lot less painful than walking (your feet aren't on the ground as long and there's less pressure on the hips!). We came back with 5 minutes to spare and I was so thankful to sit down and attempt to stretch out my legs (oh, and eat peanut butter sandwiches which taste mighty fine after a diet of 4 OSM bars, 2 small clif bars, a small handful of dried fruit, 6 squares of chocolate, 4 powerbar gels and lots and lots of replace...gotta love racing food!).

<p>I was surprised at how much energy I had during this race despite how sore my feet were...although the thought of another 12 hours on top of this was pretty scary! Oh well, still another couple of months till the Worlds! I thought we did pretty well and made an excellent team although the last couple of hours were not as successful as they could have been! As it turns out, we won the mixed grade (and 5th overall...even, somehow, beating Georgia and Fleur)! Yay! I hope Michael keeps my bottle of wine safe 'cause I deserve every bit of it!</p>

        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>Oh dear, the OY series this year is not exactly going my way! I was definitely overtired after two really late nights and my knee was still not 100% (I had only run once this week...mostly cycling to keep up the strength as it doesn't seem to affect the knee much).</p>

<p>I started off okay, although a little shaky to the first control, but then I got completely thrown at #4 and I don't really know why or what happened. I thought I'd chosen a good route choice and everything seemed to be going right but I couldn't find it for the life of me so I ended up (after a bit of bashing around) heading out to the road and taking a bearing from the clearing back in again. I found it perfectly this way but it came up heaps quicker than I expected (I almost didn't check the code 'cause I didn't think it was my control!). Yeah, I really don't know what happened!</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/epYFWHyouWb_YTV111Kc2CkT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THR7fhE93yI/AAAAAAAAEJs/z09kuCIroYQ/s400/OY6.jpg" alt="" title=""></a> <br>
<em>I don't know why it's dated 15 August since it was actually the following Sunday. Weird.</em></center> <br>
At #7 John Robbie appeared next to me and he seemed to be going the same way as I was to #8 although I knew he wouldn't be on my course but it distracted me way more than it should and I wasn't paying enough attention, ending up overrunning it and almost at #9 instead so I had to backtrack. Then all went okay again until about halfway to #12. I ran out into the cuttings and thought I knew where I was but the control never appeared where I thought it was going to so I headed up to the road to relocate, but worked it out on the way. Turns out I was way too far south. The terrain under food in the cuttings was absolutely awful and I pretty much had to walk. I think I cursed out loud when I saw I had another 2 controls to get in that area!

<p>Once I got back into the decent forest I started going better again but was feeling pretty exhausted. It felt like quite a slog to finish. I don't think I stuffed up anywhere particularly there but to be honest I was so tired I'm not sure if I can remember it! But it turns out that most people doing my course had pretty long, exhausting races too so I guess everyone found it tough out there.</p>

            <p></p><p>I used to hate rogaines and score events (same as a rogaine...but only an hour long), preferring to just follow the set course that regular orienteering provides but lately I've really started to enjoy them...which is fortunate since I have a 12 hour in Otago next month and am then doing the World Rogaine Champs in November which is a grand total of 24 hours long so you'd really hope that I liked doing them otherwise that's an epically long torture session (okay let's be honest, it's probably a bit of that too)!</p>

<p>Anyway, Counties was running a 3 hour rogaine out at Waiuku. There were 2 seperate maps...Waiuku Forest North and South, each seperated by roughly 3km of road. North went uphill, South went downhill so each had pros and cons but it did make planning interesting as getting from one map to the other was not going to be quick. I was in a team with Cath and her partner Andrew who were heading off to Vanuatu the following weekend for an adventure race. Needless to say I was extremely jealous (it even has a snorkling rogaine...I mean how cool is that?!). Anyway, Cath wasn't feeling 100% so we were never going to be going super fast but that suited me anyway as my knee hadn't been that great all week!</p>

The executive decision (Cath and I...Andrew doesn't <em>do</em> maps) was that we'd tackle the North map first and see how we went from there. I think we planned out a pretty good route to get all on the North map and they were really pretty easy controls. We probably started off a little fast for Cath but we all got into a good grove after a while. They are great fun to race with! Apart from forgetting to pick up #54 and having to race back down the road from #49 to get it, everything was pretty simple and straight forward and we got through our planned route quite a lot quicker than we expected.

The 3km down the road to the South map really took its toll on my knee injury from last weekend and I started to struggle. We hadn't really planned too much on this map as we really didn't expect to get through everything so fast but after a quick discussion I think we had a fairly good route planned out. If it wasn't for my knee and Cath feeling a bit sick, we would have pushed harder and tried to get a few more but it just wasn't worth it under the circumstances. We ended up coming in nearly 15 minutes early as I just didn't know how long I was going to be able to keep going without causing damage but it turns out we definitely could have at least go #46 on our way back. Oh well!

<p>One thing that I think would have made it cooler would have been to have different controls worth different amounts of points 'cause that would have made it a bit more strategic. Also, some tougher navigation would have been good. But all in all, it was a fun event and we ended up winning the open mixed category despite having to come in early.</p>
