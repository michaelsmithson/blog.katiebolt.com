            <p></p><p>This was the last SummerNav event for the year and also the last orienteering event for year...it's crazy how fast Christmas is arriving! Anyway, my street is actually on this map so it was always going to be a little bit exciting to have an event here. It also meant I got a nice little 5 minute warmup on the way to the event (and I was so hot by the time I arrived the thought of doing a course was a little crazy - humidity is going through the roof at the moment).</p>

<p>Unlike some previous events here, it was definitely a runners course which didn't really suit me. None of the usual scrambling around for ages in the bush wondering where the hell you were or the legs crossing over the river which either meant getting soaked or taking forever to go round. Oh well, still good fun.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/XeUwHSU4b5_YrY-tear2XCkT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQl10dypj5I/AAAAAAAAEsY/yyXKjrd0x6w/s400/SS%20-%20Western%20Springs.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
I didn't have any speed in the legs tonight (the heat and humidity probably played a big part) but at least I could keep running. The first legs were around the lake then we went into the stadium where there was a rather cruel control at the top of the hill. Then #8 and #9 were in the dodgy bush bit that really needs remapping. Then it was off to the other side of the map with some fairly straight forward legs through a couple of schools. Then it was back over to the far side of the map and a quick loop round the lake.

<p>I felt really slow but managed to cover the ground a bit quicker than expected. Felt like I was melting out there though. Now to start some proper running training for next year!</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../summer_nav_epsom_campus/">SummerNav - Epsom Campus</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>The last time I ran on this map (or at least the Epsom campus bit) was a Nationals sprint race a couple of years ago. My big memory is that it is a maze of buildings and impassable fences! It was blisteringly hot, even in the early evening and there were a lot of street legs to make up the distance on course 1. Fun times. As usual, Allan, Owen and I all turned up around the same time. Allan was first, then Owen and I started about 2 minutes after that. Got confused in the buildings on the first control which is always a brilliant start but things picked up after that and I had caught up to Owen by #8.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NSyTkusi4WAZuLztgfxSRikT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TQl1zKfScMI/AAAAAAAAEsU/oGrmG0k0wGk/s400/SS%20-%20Epsom.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
We both proceeded to run round in circles for the next few controls with the buildings causing a little bit of grief! Then it was a long leg out to Mt Eden. #15 wasn't in the right place so the group of us that had eventuated at that point just gave up and headed off to the next one. That happens at these events sometimes and it's really not much point bashing around for too long if you know exactly where you are. It was then a bit more street and building nav then up the side of Mt Eden where I finally managed to break away from Owen again.

<p>Another long leg to the final couple of controls which were in the web of buildings again (and again I didn't exactly have the best route choice). Oh, and then a sprint finish...I was pretty much dead by the end! Got a bit mauled by blackberry in one patch of bush which is always fun. The little kid at the finish who saw all the blood kept asking me if I was sure I was okay! So cute.</p>

            <h1><a href="../../../../summer_nav_craigavon/">SummerNav - Craigavon</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p>The Craigavon map is probably my favourite summer series map. It's deceptively complex despite being made up of tiny blocks of park with stretches of street inbetween. I was still not feeling that fabulous (still tired and had started feeling nauseous and dizzy quite a lot) but it's course 1 or nothing baby! As per last week, Owen, Allan and I turned up at the start together so we set off at minute intervals with me starting first. I made a few crazy mistakes and stupid route choices early on starting at #5 where I must have been standing right on top of the control but didn't see it so went searching for it!! Then I had a bad route choice to #8 which cost me a lot of time.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/NUh7bpGyoN_yEXtdVI1apikT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPasRzpo8XI/AAAAAAAAEqA/11J2-unND_s/s400/SS%20-%20Craigavon.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
Allan caught me on the way to #12 so he must have made even more mistakes at the start than I did (turned out he had a disaster at #1) 'cause he runs a lot faster than I do. We ran together for a while which was quite fun. Together we had heaps of trouble trying to find #15 on the mythical stream bend...what stream bend?! Then at #17 he took off as it flattened out (he hates hills) and I was way too tired to even try and keep up. I still found myself walking most of the hills...and there were a lot but they are pretty steep. Lame but I think I'm not quite recovered yet plus I haven't done very much running in months! I did beat Owen by miles though!!

            <p></p><p>What was I thinking letting myself get talked into running course 1 only 2 days after the World Rogaine Champs?! I just set off at a fairly casual jog with Allan, Owen and Steve setting off in minute intervals in front of me.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/OJD2R1B-HuTfKVRJOgvSwCkT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPasOkN-pAI/AAAAAAAAEp8/YxvGjOT3Jrw/s400/SS%20-%20Pt%20England.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
I was reduced to a walk with a bit of jogging after #12...any slight hill and I was completely done. Oh man, if I could have finished by then it would have been great! But then I caught up to Owen at about #14 so that meant I had to run again! I was so dead by the end that it was ridiculous (Owen and I raced each other across the field to the finish). Nice to see that my legs sort of still work though!

            <h1><a href="../../../../summer_nav_hamlins_hill/">SummerNav - Hamlins Hill</a></h1>

        </header>
        <section class="">
            <p></p><p><a href="http://www.orienteeringauckland.org.nz/summernav/">SummerNav</a> is a series of orienteering events held once a  week after work during the summer at various parks in the Auckland region. It's one of my favourite things about summer. Is that sad?!</p>

<p>I missed the first event at the Auckland Domain as I was still nursing my foot injury but thought I'd tackle the next event at <a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/hamlins-hill-mutukaroa/">Hamlins Hill</a>. On Monday night I'd gone for my first run in 6 weeks, all of 10 minutes, and the foot seemed okay but I wasn't going to push my luck since I had an 8-hour rogaine in the weekend so opted for course 2 instead of the usual course 1.</p>

<p></p><center><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/O05lG-8tm4AjdsKSWhu-ZCkT-R5DFazNDKXnuI4Ggq8?feat=embedwebsite"><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TNoSHue449I/AAAAAAAAEi4/K4xUOkJpv0E/s400/SS%20-%20Hamlins%20Hill.jpg" alt="" title=""></a></center> <br>
The ground is really rutted since it has cattle in it so it's real 'ankle breaking' stuff so running was tough and my foot wasn't too impressed. I tried to make sure that when I climbed the fences I landed on my right foot instead but it was weird because my normal climbing method involves me jumping down onto my left foot so I felt a bit unco. It was so cool to be out there running and orienteering again (orienteering on the mountain bike feels quite different) but I wasn't concentrating and made heaps of silly mistakes which is embarrassing because it was super easy navigation!

<p>I thought I did terribly, feeling slow and orienteering SO badly (I was constantly worrying about my foot, feeling excited about running again and consequently not thinking about the map at all!), but everyone else must have done worse since I ended up doing quite well in the results!</p>
