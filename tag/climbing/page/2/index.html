<span><span> <br>
Just a quick hello before I head off down South for a long weekend (running late as usual and I still haven't finished packing...it is amazing how much sports gear you need just for a few days).</span></span></p>

<p>This week is <a href="http://www.mentalhealth.org.nz/page/29-Welcome"><span><span>Mental Health Awareness Week</span></span></a><span><span> in New Zealand and on Saturday it is World Mental Health Day. I had high hopes of something interesting for this post but life and work have been chaos this week and my brain has turned to complete fuzz...</span></span></p>

<p>Last night I thrashed my previous fastest time for running home by 1 minute and 18 seconds and got under the 50 minute barrier. Since then this has, consequently, put me in a more positive frame of mind. Hoping I can keep it up over the weekend. Tomorrow is going to be tough...</p>

<p>Anyway, my best friend B and I are going to eat our way through Christchurch over the weekend (as well as do a bit of training for <a href="http://www.lacticturkey.co.nz/P6.htm"><span><span>this event</span></span></a><span><span> and scale some real rock walls which is freaking me out 'cause I've never climbed outside before but I do have a new </span></span><a href="http://www.blackdiamondequipment.com/en-us/shop/climb/harnesses/primrose-al"><span><span>harness</span></span></a><span><span> so that's exciting!) so I will be back next week with the results!</span></span></p>

<p>Here's a recent dinner to tide you over...<a href="http://www.kawanfood.com/veat/original.html"><span><span>fake chicken</span></span></a><span><span> stir-fry on wholemeal pasta (which you can't see 'cause it's buried under everything else).</span></span></p>

Oh, and our little wolf (</span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/08/puppy-vs-cat-epic-battle.html"><span><span>Keisha</span></span></a><span><span>) is growing up so fast! She'll be full-sized (which is HUGE) before I know it.

Right, back to packing!</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>There was nothing I could do. There were no precautions I could take. There was no place I could hide. There was no one who could help me. <br>

<span><span> <br>
It's probably just me but I thought you might be interested in what a "normal" weekday looks like for me. Every day is quite different but you get the general idea...</span></span></p>

<p>So the alarm on my phone goes off at 5:10am...welcome to Monday morning. I drag on my gym gear...laid out on the chair the night before so I don't have to use my brain. I try and drink as much water as I can manage and eat one of <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/09/fueling-up.html"><span><span>these</span></span></a><span><span>...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdpOFnnwI/AAAAAAAACxY/K7QEO6xYgq4/s400/IMG_2640.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Off to the </span></span><a href="http://www.olympicpools.co.nz/"><span><span>gym</span></span></a><span><span>! There is a queue of us completely insane people waiting outside for opening time at 5:45am. We file in, dump our gear in the lockers and head upstairs and across the bridge over the pool into the gym where I head to the peleton room and claim a bike (this is why I'm here so early...bikes go pretty fast especially as the weather improves...don't know why that is!). Spin class starts at 6:05am and is a 45 minute torture session taken by my friend L. After class I head over to the floor to finish up with some core exercises and stretches.

<p>Time to hit the showers. I only wash my hair once a week (okay, so I rinse it if it gets too icky from sport but that's it) and Monday is the day...the gym showers are great and I don't feel quite so bad about taking too long. Because I have a really sensitive scalp I use </p></span></span><a href="http://www.purist.com/product.php?product=24"><span><span>this shampoo</span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="http://www.purist.com/product.php?product=36"><span><span>this conditioner</span></span></a><span><span>. These don't make my hair as soft and silky as other products I've tried but they don't make my scalp feel like it's erupting which is rather more important!

<p>It's then off to work where I'll have breakfast at my desk. Yesterday it was a spelt muffin and fruit but sometimes I'll have toast with almond butter and jam. If I'm at home for breakfast it's normally weetbix, fruit and rice milk.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdqJWOXLI/AAAAAAAACxc/tRAn8YJOZaU/s400/IMG_2642.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>Did I really just take a photo of fruit? Not very exciting...well, as a photo anyway!</span></span></em></center><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdrK9eu1I/AAAAAAAACxg/2UXoPZf6XRU/s400/IMG_2645.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Work comes and goes but no doubt I'll spend a bit too much time having email conversations with a couple of my friends as I count down till lunchtime!

<p>Lunchtime has been leftovers lately which is awesome. When I'm cooking dinner I'll often try to make extra 'cause I don't want to have to buy lunch (for a start there aren't that many options near my office).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdsHgDQOI/AAAAAAAACxk/Df7_OZAY0oU/s400/IMG_2646.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yesterday was leftover Pumpkin and Kumara Soup from the freezer mixed with leftover veges and tofu from another night - a double-whammy of leftovers!

<p>Often Monday nights are quiet but last night I was climbing with my brother and his friend at </p></span></span><a href="http://extremeedge.co.nz/"><span><span>Extreme Edge</span></span></a><span><span>. We usually climb together about once a week but the night is always different to fit in with everyone's schedules. We are looking at doing a lead climbing course soon which is pretty much freaking me out.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVxIYItdaI/AAAAAAAACys/abyDqSqMEN0/s400/IMG_2658.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVxGwhHCsI/AAAAAAAACyo/YLi42bd8iUs/s400/IMG_2663.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>My brother really wanted his arse to feature on this blog so here it is, just for you darling bro!</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, before climbing I will normally snack on a muesli bar of some sort. Last night it was a Cool Mint Chocolate </span></span><a href="http://www.clifbar.com/"><span><span>Clif Bar</span></span></a><span><span>, my favourite.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVui6dTmsI/AAAAAAAACyc/XlWXWudPhSY/s400/IMG_2647.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>I just noticed that there is a picture of a climber on the clif bar packet...how appropriate!</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
By the time I get home I'll no doubt be exhausted as I always fail in my resolution to go to bed early on a Sunday night so very little sleep will have been had! I'll also undoubtably be hungry (if we haven't gone to get </span></span><a href="https://hellpizza.co.nz/"><span><span>Hell Pizza</span></span></a><span><span> after climbing). Last night I was too lazy to do anything so I had nut butter and jam on toast! Terrible I know but it was after 9pm when I got home and sometimes you just can't be bothered.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVuk3mETPI/AAAAAAAACyk/HGIMyiw_Qls/s400/IMG_2671.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is actually a photo of a previous breakfast but I forgot to take a photo of my dinner...but they looked exactly the same! I also discovered I had a bliss ball in the fridge from </span></span><a href="http://www.thebluebird.co.nz/"><span><span>The Blue Bird</span></span></a><span><span> so I snacked on that too. Yummy!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVuj2u00YI/AAAAAAAACyg/gB9ikWGfTxo/s400/IMG_2669.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'll then pack my bags and organise my gear and in the fridge I'll put all my breakfast and lunch food for the next day in a bag ready for me to grab as I race out the door. Then I can finally drop into bed (always aiming for 10pm but not always succeeding!) and look forward to doing it all again in the morning!

<p>Hmmmm, this seems to make my life seem somewhat boring but actually it's pretty cool (well, I think so anyway) and hopelessly busy (</p></span></span><a href="https://www.google.com/calendar"><span><span>Google Calendar</span></span></a><span><span> saves my life). I often wonder how I'm going to make it to the end of the week without dropping from exhaustion but I always do and am always ready and waiting for the week to start again come Sunday night!</span></span>
