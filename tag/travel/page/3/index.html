...otherwise known as Saturday in Christchurch.</span></span></p>

<p>It started with coffee...or, more specifically, since I've never drunk a cup of coffee in my life, a ginger chai latte with rice milk from <a href="http://theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojwD03Z0I/AAAAAAAAEBQ/UKaE4bBN9pk/s400/IMG_3891.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I then wanted vegan pancakes and nobody was going to stop me...I doused them in maple syrup and they really didn't last long at all. I love pancakes (oh, and they can make them gluten free too if you so desire)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojuBF7HoI/AAAAAAAAEBM/BwTtr5cq4LE/s400/IMG_3892.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I've only just recently started climbing again after various injuries and events got in the way. Unfortunately winter is not really the best time for climbing outside so we just hit up The Roxx. Just so you know, I don't normally climb in socks (or polypro pants for that matter) but my feet were too cold.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoa6l4vgZI/AAAAAAAAD_M/a5DfpszMc2A/s400/IMG_3897.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There was an emergency peanut butter sandwich consumed partway through (well, not partway through a climb because that might be a little crazy).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojsdp-mnI/AAAAAAAAEBI/nXkPDe3Kfos/s400/IMG_3903.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yes, I have chalk all over my hands...they don't normally look that weird.

<p>Climbing makes me hungry so we went exploring for a stop of lunch/afternoon tea. And what did we find?</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobWITIeKI/AAAAAAAAEAc/lrRIbonAdtE/s400/IMG_3904.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yep, it's </span></span><a href="http://www.eternaldelight.net/"><span><span>Eternal Delight</span></span></a><span><span> - a raw vegan cafe. I didn't even know they existed (well, in New Zealand anyway). It was all terribly exciting but I had to remember we were going out for a fancy dinner so we couldn't eat too much so we decided to split a main and a dessert. B chose the Italian pizza and salad.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoa9NUBoXI/AAAAAAAAD_Q/fkRqNUYFu6s/s400/IMG_3913.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Seriously this was amazing. I don't know how they did it but just looking at the photo right now makes me want it again real bad. The salad especially was very impressive (yes, the pizza was great but there was something about that salad...).

<p>As a sweet treat I picked the Superfood Black Forest Cake which uses goji berries instead of cherries. The guy gave us a discount because it had fallen over. He said that normally it stands tall and proud. Again it was pretty awesome. We decided we'd have to come back here for their Friday night fine dining next time I'm down.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobUuYKM5I/AAAAAAAAEAY/243WuNBwbso/s400/IMG_3915.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And then we raced home to check <a href="http://www.trademe.co.nz/">trademe</a> (like eBay I guess but specifically for us here in New Zealand). You see, I had placed an auto bid on a road bike as the auction was going to close while we were out so I had no idea if I'd won or not. But guess what?! I won!!! This is exciting news number 1 (more to follow in the next post). I will probably post photos of it everywhere at some point. It's awesome!

<p>Anyway, moving on! Dinner was a special occasion made even more special because B and I were joined by my beautiful cousin D and her boyfriend. So basically, it was dinner with my bestest friends in the whole world and it really can't get much better than that. We decided to go to </p></span></span><a href="http://thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart </span></span></a><span><span>because it's fancy and they do awesome food.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobTayytKI/AAAAAAAAEAU/KW8dhSTr7jU/s400/IMG_3919.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Fries first...you can't really go wrong with that (plus their homemade tomato sauce is real good...they should bottle and sell it 'cause I'd definitely buy it). B ordered tea and I had to take a photo...I </span></span><strong><span><span>want</span></span></strong><span><span> this tea set.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobSLQrT_I/AAAAAAAAEAQ/XET_oevfYvE/s400/IMG_3920.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
D and I went with their homemade ginger beer...you also can't go wrong with that. I order it every single time.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobOE970BI/AAAAAAAAEAE/bWfyzbIYp0Y/s400/IMG_3921.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For our mains B and I decided to order a couple of different things and share (D and her boyfriend did the same). We got the vegan pizza which had their special cashew vegan aioli on it...I have to try this 'cause it tasted super cheesy (well, at least my memory of cheesy).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobQ1j-Y6I/AAAAAAAAEAM/YDgAtK9nqvQ/s400/IMG_3923.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We also ordered the curry of the day. Somehow I have managed to delete the photo I took of this...oops! Anyway, I can't remember now what it was but it was tasty which is really all that counts. I think the waiter was quite impressed that we polished off all this food with such ease (and then casually asked for the dessert menu too).

<p>Dessert...raw pumpkin pie with raw ice cream. Oh my god! This was really REALLY good. So good that I was very surprised. It was also a ridiculously large portion and I couldn't even finish it which is quite a rare thing for me. I had to take the leftovers home (there was no way I was letting it go to waste!).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobPdiXeGI/AAAAAAAAEAI/LVbk9z1QBRg/s400/IMG_3927.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And to finish off an awesome night? We went to live comedy...a perfect night (especially because B and I tried to book too late so they'd sold out but somehow 2 people cancelled right before the show was about to start so we got their tickets).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojzRuUMZI/AAAAAAAAEBY/M77Bi71QLuc/s400/IMG_3933.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

...otherwise known as Friday in Christchurch.</span></span></p>

<p>If you're going to be out traipsing across the hills all day then you're going to need a big, hearty breakfast. This is where my epic porridge comes in...for the 2 of us I used 1 cup of wholegrain oats, 1 cup rice milk and 1 cup water. About halfway through cooking I added 2 heaped tablespoons of peanut butter, 2 sliced bananas and some frozen berries. Topped with golden syrup this was absolutely perfect (as we huddled next to the fire)!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobBjQoV3I/AAAAAAAAD_c/5weIEhugPyI/s400/IMG_3843.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
So after breakfast and much debate over where we were going to go, we headed off to tackle as much of the</span></span><a href="http://tramper.co.nz/?208"><span><span> Crater Rim Walkway</span></span></a><span><span> that we could before it got dark (we should have got up earlier in hindsight but holidays are for sleeping in right?). The below photo is looking down into Lyttleton Harbour from the Port Hills.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobaGTv4rI/AAAAAAAAEAk/zG-oF8IKk9o/s400/IMG_3849.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Along the way you encounter various gun emplacements and what we could only assume were once bomb shelters or something similar. The artwork on some of these was really quite fascinating...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFor_1b3VEI/AAAAAAAAECs/G2VUDrlrxTA/s400/IMG_3851.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

</span></span><em><span><span>We live in a free country where you are free to do nothing</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
B thought he'd bring his gas cooker along so lunch was really quite civilised. That morning I'd fried up some cubes of tofu and we just added that to a packet soup (</span></span><a href="http://www.nakedorganics.co.nz/"><span><span>Naked Organics</span></span></a><span><span> Thai Coconut Curry).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobY8z--oI/AAAAAAAAEAg/u4LvOicVGxQ/s400/IMG_3863.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

Ah, a hot lunch...just perfect for a beautiful, but freezing day on the hills.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobftCWh8I/AAAAAAAAEA4/OdlBVFIqBCg/s400/IMG_3865.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was our turnaround point since we didn't really feel like wandering in the dark. As it was, we got back with enough time but the sky was definitely well on its way to darkening.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobiyN2TAI/AAAAAAAAEBA/y6xinE8eM1c/s400/IMG_3868.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'm not much of a walker so I was feeling rather stiff by the end and was quite glad to curl up in the car on the way home again (it's ironic really...I could run that track and probably feel fine but when it comes to walking I just get tired!).

<p>We were pretty hungry by then so dinner was definitely in order. We were joined by B's friend M and thought we'd check out somewhere we hadn't been before, the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.welcomecafe.co.nz/"><span><span>Welcome Chinese Vegetarian Cafe</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p>As a starter for everyone we ordered the Crispy Savoury Cheeky Nuggets simply because it is such an awesome name!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobEuE5lYI/AAAAAAAAD_k/Y38mtCUKfzA/s400/IMG_3876.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We each got to pick a main dish that we would all share and I ended up choosing the Hotplate Sambal Lemon Eggplant Tofu.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobGMJ0HxI/AAAAAAAAD_o/pI1nIsGgw90/s400/IMG_3878.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
M ordered this dish but I actually can't remember what it was. My main memory was that it was quite spicy but delicious.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobHQVjtJI/AAAAAAAAD_s/SZ_MHyqOTYs/s400/IMG_3881.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
B ordered us the Crispy Sesame BBQ Fried Rice on Hotplate which is described as BBQ Sesame sauce over Crispy protein with Nori and fried rice. Let's just say that to me that description sounds highly unappetising but it turned out to be my favourite of all the dishes. The 'crispy protein with nori' was absolutely delicious and I should have taken a cutaway photo of it 'cause it looked so cool.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobIqu4iCI/AAAAAAAAD_w/SAXur9EtFjc/s400/IMG_3884.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dessert is, of course, very important and I got some vegan ice cream because, well, it was on the menu and that in itself is pretty exciting.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobM0Sh6TI/AAAAAAAAD_8/X75EFg9PCrs/s400/IMG_3887.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We also got some red bean pastries to share because I love red bean. I was kind of hoping for something like the red bean pancakes I get in Auckland but it was not to be. These were still pretty good though.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobLTObakI/AAAAAAAAD_4/A3oLMC8sFRE/s400/IMG_3889.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dinner (we'll definitely be coming back to this restaurant) and company was nice and all but I was quite happy to get back to B's flat and sit in front of the fire with a nice cup of tea. I'm such a nana!</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
In preparation for my food being reduced to this for most of a weekend (yeah, terribly appealing)...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TAR4PQVALlI/AAAAAAAADxE/nNEsxE0GGRM/s400/IMG_3635.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...on Friday I had a day of extreme eating out with my mate B in Christchurch. After all, I needed the fueling for my epic race the next day (which turned out to be a bit more epic than I imagined!).

<p>Last time I visited we attempted to go to </p></span></span><a href="http://theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span> but it was closed. This time luck was on our side...yay! The Orange Tree seems to specialise in all kinds of special diets but the main attraction was that it could make vegan pancakes. They were served with caramalised bananas, fresh fruit, jam and maple syrup. Oh man, they were seriously awesome. I have to come back here again!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TAR4AT7BzhI/AAAAAAAADwc/LFK0x6Ubar4/s400/IMG_3617.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also had a ginger chai latte with rice milk on the suggestion of the waitress and it was delicious. The ginger gave it a real, um, zing (?). Yum.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TAR3-_FJfRI/AAAAAAAADwY/7UNCZOBhSmU/s400/IMG_3615.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We went climbing after breakfast so got lunch to takeaway...at <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews.php?id=7315">Soul Food</a> where I just had to get the vegan BLT again (which was served with 3 different salady things). If you come to Christchurch...go here and get this. It's good.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TAR4BupVHlI/AAAAAAAADwg/OwtYrcjY-Eo/s400/IMG_3619.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also got a ginger slice to take away for afternoon tea. Perfectly decadent and unnecessary but it had to be done.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TAR4CbjgubI/AAAAAAAADwk/mmGdo6pGz88/s400/IMG_3624.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then came the main event...dinner. We decided (okay, I decided and B agreed) that we had to go to </span></span><a href="http://thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span>. I think this has to be my favourite vegetarian food place. I can never visit Christchurch without eating here at least once. I started with their wonderful house-made ginger beer.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TAR39mxh_YI/AAAAAAAADwU/GPsoaI1Cytk/s400/IMG_3626.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
B was getting some fancy entree but I was feeling like fries. Don't know why. So I ordered their fries with house-made tomato sauce and vegan cashew aioli...their aioli is so incredible. B was impressed with my powers to almost demolish the entire pots of both sauces!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TAR4D73RnlI/AAAAAAAADws/7-fYe4dgAdo/s400/IMG_3627.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I really wanted to order the <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/10/garden-city-adventures-part-two.html">Sun Burger</a> again for my main but I resisted and ordered something different instead...the Masala Dosa which is a South Indian lentil and rice pancake filled with potato masala filling and is served with rasam (which is apparently like a sort of soup) and coconut chutney. It was HUGE and defeated me (well, I'm sure I could have tried harder to finish it if I wasn't planning on dessert). But boy was it delicious. Definitely one to order again!!

I couldn't decide on dessert so I listened to my stomach which was calling out for chocolate so I wasn't very original and ordered the vegan chocolate cake with some kind of berry sorbet. It was delicious.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TAR4I7X6QXI/AAAAAAAADw4/jbULk5fTShs/s400/IMG_3632.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yep, that's a lot of food (and very few veggies in sight) but boy was it worth it!

<p>So what was I doing this past weekend? TWALK - a crazy twenty-four hour orienteering event held every year in Canterbury somewhere...and you get to dress up!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TBG5KujqbqI/AAAAAAAAD2k/4hZzO063E20/s400/100529_110956.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yep, there was snow (think patches of nearly waist-deep snow at 2am on the top of a mountain...it was cold!)...and it was awesome fun (okay, there were some patches where I hated it but that's the same with any race). Can't wait until next year...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TBG5JXmN5MI/AAAAAAAAD2g/OHVCJAw03uc/s400/100529_145151.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, I won't bore you now (or have you think I'm too crazy) but when I get a chance (and have caught up on some much needed sleep) I'll post a race report over </span></span><a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
Yep, there are three things to 'yay' about in this post...well, for me anyway.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Number One</span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
I used to have a favourite burger to order when heading out with friends to our favourite burger chain, </span></span><a href="http://www.burgerfuel.com/"><span><span>Burger Fuel</span></span></a><span><span> (they had 4 vegetarian burgers, one specifically vegan even and the buns are wholemeal...crazy!). Anyway, it was called the Combustion Tofu Burger. Just ditch the aioli and you're good to go.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S_MyUrUPUoI/AAAAAAAADuw/5qRNSc4OGRo/s400/IMG_3594.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Tragically it dropped off the menu a while ago (so long ago I don't even remember) and I'd had to resort to eating lesser burgers! Because we live in crazy times, there are in fact, 2 groups on Facebook dedicated to bringing back this clearly quite popular burger: </span></span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=52288846212&amp;v=info&amp;ref=search"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=53345740855&amp;ref=search&amp;sid=595143902.1566113849..1"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>. Madness!

<p>Anyway, the night I was enjoying my satay tofu burger down in Queenstown, The Chef was enjoying a satay tofu burger up in Auckland which mystified me...'cause where were you supposed to get one of those these days since they took it off the menu at Burger Fuel? When I asked, it turns out it's back on the menu again in Auckland (I'm pretty sure it's just at the Auckland joints but I could be wrong)...temporarily.</p>

<p>So I'm sure you all can guess what I had for lunch the next day...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S_MyV2DAnKI/AAAAAAAADu0/mpzABKxPfM0/s400/IMG_3596.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...oh yes! I have to admit I had fairly high expectations (it had been built up pretty high in my imagination) and unfortunately didn't quite live up to them but hey, it's back!!!

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span>Number Two</span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
I got sent cookies! Who knew boys could bake (well, obviously The Chef can...but he's a chef funnily enough so I'm not sure he counts)? M sent me a batch of chocolate cookies with a cool peanut buttery filling. Awesome! I am predictably easy to please!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S_MyW89vUlI/AAAAAAAADu4/PnGGFP8-ouM/s400/IMG_3597.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They kind of stuck together in transportation but really that doesn't matter when they taste as good as they do (which is super delicious). I guess this means I have to bake something equally delicious for my team for the race next weekend as payback.

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span>Number Three</span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
I'm off on the plane tonight to good old Christchurch for good food, awesome friends, challenging rock climbing and crazy racing (24 hours!!!). It's going to be one hell of a weekend!</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
So, it didn't flood while I was in Queenstown. In fact the weather was pretty amazing (well, it was freezing but it is basically winter so you can't have everything). The lake levels were definitely up (some of the trees on the lake edge were under water) and buildings on the waterfront were barricaded with sandbags but the rain had stopped by the time I arrived. Below is the view from the deck of the apartment (I got a similar view from my bedroom on the floor below). We were working up here too so when things got too stressful I snuck a peak out the window and it was quite refreshing.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9_L2LKi3kI/AAAAAAAADrU/Ty2iyjmRcl8/s400/IMG_3533.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
As far as food went, we ate out every dinner but I was mostly out with my boss so I wasn't in picture-taking mode (he thinks I'm weird enough as it is I think!). But I did get one night to myself...no trip to Queenstown is complete without a visit to </span></span><a href="http://www.fergburger.com/"><span><span>FergBurger</span></span></a><span><span>. This is the Holier Than Thou burger which is tempured tofu with a spicy satay, coconut, coriander sauce, lettuce, tomato, red onion and alfalfa (it also comes with aioli but I got them to ditch that).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S9_LpSLHzuI/AAAAAAAADrA/HA2o5uH-FLg/s400/IMG_3539.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yes, the burger is massive...that is a dinner plate it is sitting on. I'm not sure what possessed me to order chips since they give you enough to feed a small army (I ate quite a bit more than what is pictured and still hadn't made it through half). This time I couldn't even finish all the burger. I got about three quarters of the way through before giving up and just eating the filling. I was so full I could barely move (I swear I cannot eat the amount that I could not that long ago...it's weird).

<p>Anyway, to avoid this post being devoid of much food (and just generally lacking!), I will present you with food I've eaten since getting back from Queenstown!</p>

<p>My mate B was up from Christchurch for the weekend so I dragged him over for dinner on Saturday along with The Chef. While I made satay tofu...my way (there was a debate about this at the supermarket), the boys prepared dessert. Anyway, my satay tofu on brown rice is quite possibly one of my favourite meals ever and definitely my favourite pre-race meal (I had a race on Sunday morning) so I made a huge batch which gave me leftovers to have cold for lunch the next day.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-h3mMyIGwI/AAAAAAAADtA/pWS2Jk-h1TA/s400/IMG_3591.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dessert was gluten-free crumble as The Chef was on the last couple of days of his diet thingy. While B peeled the 5 apples (there was a funny debate about whether to have 4 or 5 apples at the supermarket too!), The Chef whipped up an awesome topping. I think it was made from buckwheat flour, chopped almonds, coconut, brown sugar, cinnamon and oliviani...but I can't really remember). Once the apples were all chopped, they added frozen blueberries and a truck-load of sugar (no wonder crumbles taste so sweat and delicious in restaurants!) and chucked it in the oven while we ate dinner.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-h3oL2lCkI/AAAAAAAADtE/zZNcutYPZOg/s400/IMG_3593.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
SO good!

<p>Sunday was Mother's Day so after a day of orienteering (my parents both compete too sometimes) and a quick blat round the mountain bike park my brother and I trouped off to my parents' house for dinner. Vegetarian Shepherd's Pie and salad...awesome winter comfort food.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-dozDsRh1I/AAAAAAAADs4/TqNbsDkU7SE/s400/Mothers%20day%202%20CS2.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was going to make a fancy dessert (I really want to try and make sweet potato (kumara) pie with maple syrup) but time was never going to be on my side so instead I made crumble...yep, crumble 2 nights in a row!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S-do0E9NeAI/AAAAAAAADs8/M-dA55EfI9g/s400/Mothers%20day%203%20CS2.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Apple and berry crumble with a crumble topping made with rolled oats, wholemeal flour, chopped almonds, coconut, dark brown sugar, cinnamon, and olivani. So good! And Mum sent me home with leftovers which I ended up eating for breakfast the next day (she also sent me home with homemade bread she had in the freezer so I didn't have to worry about lunch)!

<p>Ah, mothers, what would we do without them?! ☺</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
Hello!!</span></span></p>

<p>In the past week I got to hang out in 3 of my favourite places ever as well as having some cool adventures. I had last week off work so on the Monday I cruised up to my mate's farm at Slater Road (one of my favourite places) to help out on the farm, rake some mountain bike tracks in their huge private park and get some biking and kayaking coaching. Paddling up through the mangroves was so awesome especially when we had to bash our way through in parts!</p>

<p>Of course, I can't go up there without going running with Jess so we had our own little adventure on the Tuesday afternoon. It was supposed to be a short run but time seems to melt away in the forest.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HJJ-DCnzI/AAAAAAAADi0/9ARUNZydLOs/s400/IMG_3438.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Here's Jess inside afterwards...the ultimate training companion and boy can she go fast when she wants to!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HJMnNPcPI/AAAAAAAADjA/uh7s7TgE6gY/s400/IMG_3441.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
To prove I am capable of relaxing, the following morning The Chef and I headed off to my beach house at </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Waikauri+Bay,+New+Zealand&amp;sll=-36.618697,174.342384&amp;sspn=0.089832,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=Febk1P0dEGZrCg&amp;split=0&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Waikauri+Bay&amp;z=13"><span><span>Waikauri Bay</span></span></a><span><span> which is quite possibly my favourite place in the whole world. I have many awesome memories of endless summers playing in the waves and exploring the hills. Pretty much all we did was eat, read, wander along the beach and round the rocks and laze about.

<p>Anyway, on the drive up we stopped off at the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.matakanavillage.co.nz/stores/black_dog_cafe.php"><span><span>Black Dog Cafe</span></span></a><span><span> in Matakana for lunch. I got this warmed roast vegetable salad which was really nice but not exactly filling.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9sdVBwPI/AAAAAAAADjs/HFrPFBURm0Q/s400/IMG_3444.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dinner more than made up for a light lunch (although we did demolish a packet of pita crisps) with tofu sausages topped with fried onion and mushrooms alongside steamed broccoli and kumara chips. I think I ate my weight in kumara chips that night!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9tl6kTdI/AAAAAAAADjw/kTd6L5bq42E/s400/IMG_3446.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The following morning we ate the leftover kumara chips covered in maple syrup. I had no idea this would be such a good combination but I am definitely going to have it again soon!

<p>I had leftover waffle mixture in my freezer from the dessert party so brought that up with us for breakfast the next day. While I was in charge of the waffles, The Chef cooked up some caramelised apple and feijoas in maple syrup.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9vGBlB2I/AAAAAAAADj0/ab444KnN-gM/s400/IMG_3447.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Throughout the course of the day we managed to polish off over a kilogram of feijoas. Well, the bag had to be finished so it was up to us to eat them all! I love feijoa season!

<p>Lunch of champions...falafel, fresh bread with hummus and a mega salad.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9wK8EjkI/AAAAAAAADj4/HvtjnRWoUXA/s400/IMG_3450.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The Chef thought he'd eat his portion as a sandwich. Um, yeah...watching him try to wrap his mouth around this mammoth monster was hilarious!

<p>But I can never relax for too long and Thursday night I was off to the airport and flying down South to Otago for the National Orienteering Champs. This is my first year running in the elite grade for all races so I was pretty excited...but pretty nervous.</p>

<p>The first race was the sprint event in </p></span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=roxburgh,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-36.866443,174.772559&amp;sspn=0.044771,0.066347&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Roxburgh,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=13"><span><span>Roxburgh</span></span></a><span><span>. Ah, not my finest moment after a bad route choice ending up in thick scrub down a valley. But I did pull out some good splits for the last few controls which was good since you were visible to all the spectators on the hill for that final section!</span></span><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p92FvePPI/AAAAAAAADkA/YlfF86zPP8U/s400/IMG_3453.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The second day was the middle distance event in </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Bannockburn,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.539919,169.313904&amp;sspn=0.078392,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Bannockburn,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=12"><span><span>Bannockburn</span></span></a><span><span> which was just out of Cromwell. Heaps of cliffs, some killer climbs and more scrub for me to get caught in!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p93EgmJ0I/AAAAAAAADkE/VNan3deU9-0/s400/IMG_3456.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The long distance event was just out of Alexandra at </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Earnscleugh,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.089691,169.161136&amp;sspn=0.158035,0.265388&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Earnscleugh,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=13"><span><span>Earnscleugh Station</span></span></a><span><span> and it was bitterly cold, very exposed, quite steep, very rocky, extremely fast terrain and (for us running the elite women's grade) a very long course. Oh, and a nasty barbed wire, outrigger fence. Below is the final stretch to the finish and boy was I glad to make it that far!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p94Ybg9cI/AAAAAAAADkI/IpCQCtFRhXw/s400/IMG_3461.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'm not normally a fan of the relay event 'cause it always feels like so much pressure...if you stuff up or manage to mispunch or something then you let your whole team down but I was so looking forward to this one 'cause it was being held in </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Naseby,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.21606,169.310859&amp;sspn=0.078843,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Naseby,+New+Zealand&amp;z=11"><span><span>Naesby</span></span></a><span><span> which is another very special place to me. Oh, and I was in an awesome relay team with a couple of great mates out to have fun. We decided not to take it too seriously and wore our race numbers sideways just to be a bit different.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p95XrL0tI/AAAAAAAADkM/MFtOzCaah8Q/s400/IMG_3471.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Here's the start of the relay which is always chaos. Lucky I was second-leg runner.</span></span><div><span style="font-family:verdana, serif;"><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family:verdana, serif;"><span>So after all that adventuring I was actually quite glad to arrive home to Auckland and it gave me its usual greeting by pouring down with rain! It's good to be home.</span></span></div></div>
