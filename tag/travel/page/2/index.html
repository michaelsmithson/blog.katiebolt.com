Actually, it hadn't been all that cold but I felt I was due a little artistic license. My mind soared and swooped, way above everything. I could see so much! I felt like God. This was fun. <br>

<span><span> <br>
How come it feels so good to get home again and yet it sucks at the same time? Why do some of my most favourite people have to be so far away? And why does my backlog of photos never stop growing?! Oh well! We'll get there...eventually.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXBXRBktI/AAAAAAAAEgU/ob1r2OvsJrI/s400/IMG_4450.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, you might be pleased to know that I am still in one piece. I did not fall down a 12 metre cliff and neither did I get a stick through my front wheel and come off breaking my sternum or ribs. I left those adventures to others in the team!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXDcgF15I/AAAAAAAAEgY/91wMOgc0Rcg/s400/IMG_4478.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I did, however, ride for 25 hours (that's 9 days in a row of racing and training), get some wicked cuts and bruises from crashing into rocks, fell off my bike in a bog and got completely submerged and spent more than 2 hours cleaning the mud off my bike and shoes only to find NZ customs in a relaxed mood.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXIn9ZbwI/AAAAAAAAEgo/9FNZNpbWtYc/s400/IMG_4516.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I laughed so hard that I thought I might explode, got attacked by a magpie (seriously...you can see where the beak of the bird wedged into my helmet!), lazed in the spa pool and learnt more about bikes in 9 days than I ever had in the last 3 years of riding. When I finally get a chance, there'll be more info about the trip up </span></span><a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span> if anyone is interested.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXMbVzqRI/AAAAAAAAEgw/EQr6SjPrue0/s400/IMG_4558.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Oh, and I also managed to eat some pretty good food. I didn't photograph most of it (like the awesome vegan lasagnas that got whipped up for us non-meat eaters one night) because I am a bit slack but rest assured, you will not go hungry even in small towns in Australia (I found tofu, both plain and marinated, veggie burgers, oat milk and all sorts of other staples in every supermarket I went to).

<p>This is the only photo of food that we actually cooked. This was our second night in Mt Gambia and there were three of us girls cooking together in our little unit. We were lazy and bought pre-prepared stir-fry veggies since we were traveling the next day.</p>

<p></p></span></span> <center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNQ7DudGI/AAAAAAAAEfo/uQSlwGWZ614/s400/IMG_4431.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Next stop was a farmstay not far out of Carisbrook. It had the most awesome kitchen where we would cook up communal meals each night. Down the road in Marybourgh there was a cafe (Legendz) that could make soy milkshakes. After a hot day out in the forest I couldn't think of anything better!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXE3xbtrI/AAAAAAAAEgc/W8wQzCpvsB0/s400/IMG_4488.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It was thick, cold and delicious...and I drunk it so fast that I got a headache!

<p>Food-wise, Daylseford was when it got exciting. We'd just arrived and were mulling around town whist some people were sussing out somewhere good for coffee when one of my team mates spotted a sign outside one of the cafes saying it was vegetarian and vegan.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNS7rlX6I/AAAAAAAAEfs/mKhigXafMxQ/s400/IMG_4528.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My first trip (we went twice) to the </span></span><a href="http://www.himalayabakery.com/"><span><span>Himalaya Bakery</span></span></a><span><span> I got a mini chocolate cake and organic cola.

<p>I also got an apple and cinnimon scroll to take away with me too (oh, and later on I got one to eat on the plane home too...they were big and deliciously filling).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNUqg-zII/AAAAAAAAEfw/TV0Xy4pz3XE/s400/IMG_4529.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Our first night we all went out to dinner at the </span></span><a href="http://oldhepburnhotel.com.au/"><span><span>Old Hepburn Hotel</span></span></a><span><span>. I got a veganised version of the vegetable and kidney bean nachos which was pretty good but I could have done with more bean mix and less corn chips. It didn't last all that long though (riding every day makes you hungry...and incredibly tipsy on one bottle of alcoholic ginger beer and therefore your table's entertainment for the evening)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNWrrtZZI/AAAAAAAAEf0/A52NQuiIJqw/s400/IMG_4563.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Saturday night was the social function at a pub down the road. Food was catered but I'd organised in advance for a meal to be provided for me. They ended up changing their vegetarian dish to make it vegan which I thought was pretty cool...green curry with tofu and tempeh. Not anything flash or amazing but it filled me up and, quite frankly, I was hungry so as long as it was edible I wasn't really fussed.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNYJcALtI/AAAAAAAAEf4/1BELSCXHRsI/s400/IMG_4571.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And for dessert they served me a big bowl filled with grapes and strawberries. Everyone else at my table was jealous and I had to fight them off!

<p>After our final race we went into town again for lunch and boy did I need food by then...desperately (after nearly 3 hours of mountain biking I was pretty desperate)! I managed to convince over half the team to join me at the Himalaya Bakery again! Everyone had to agree the food was really good.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMZNaBORMtI/AAAAAAAAEf8/l42OY8L07DU/s400/IMG_4573.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I got the open veggie burger (I think it was made from lentils). It was good. So basically, if you find yourself near </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;q=daylesford,+australia&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Daylesford+VIC,+Australia&amp;ei=CjzJTO-aL8-1cPmViDM&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=geocode_result&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CB0Q8gEwAA"><span><span>Daylesford</span></span></a><span><span>, go here. I really recommend it.

<p>For our final night we went out to the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.ballarat.com/jasminethai/index.htm"><span><span>Jasmine Thai Restaurant</span></span></a><span><span> in Hepburn Springs. Items on the menu that could be veganised were clearly labelled which was super cool and my meal was delicious. Of course I was pretty forgetful that evening and forgot my camera again. Typical...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TMeXNrm14TI/AAAAAAAAEg0/Zd7kz2nI7mo/s400/IMG_4575.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...but after over 2 hours of cleaning my bike and bike shoes (I don't think either have ever been this clean since they were brand new - look how sparkly it is!) I was completely exhausted.

<p>So all in all it was an awesome trip (and this is a ridiculously long post). Plans are already underway for next year...</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
I go to Australia at the end of this week! I would be excited except for the fact that I'm terrified. You see, this is what happened last weekend when I was out training...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKfnHOUqvgI/AAAAAAAAEeE/NEDZX4WV918/s400/IMG_4362.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and I'd had to climb up several metres in order to take this photo! The general consensus among some of my friends is that my mountain bike has gotten jealous of my road bike and decided it would throw me off just to make sure I knew who was boss. I ended up with mild concussion and head trauma. Thanks.

<p>Anyway, we will worry about the racing when I get there and instead I will show you the delicious dinner party I had with a couple of friends the other night.</p>

<p>J made some awesome roast veggies (kumara, potato, carrot and pumpkin). You can't really go wrong there.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pdYZlYwI/AAAAAAAAEfA/UC-o4Uv89_c/s400/IMG_4343.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Our beautiful host made a big pot of vermicelli noodle stir-fry with heaps of veggies and flavoured with soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pe_CbNSI/AAAAAAAAEfE/KI8H_eGdqdc/s400/IMG_4344.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here is my plate (oh okay, my first plate 'cause let's be honest, it was really good and I was really hungry).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pglVnGcI/AAAAAAAAEfI/ylSAb6XDoHQ/s400/IMG_4345.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was in charge of dessert and after wondering what to make for ages I ended up making the </span></span><a href="http://veganzestforlife.blogspot.com/2010/09/caramel-cream-pie-oo-la-la.html"><span><span>Caramel Cream Pie</span></span></a><span><span> from Alice's </span></span><a href="http://veganzestforlife.blogspot.com/"><span><span>blog</span></span></a><span><span>. You see, I'd had a tin of this soy condensed milk and a packet of the soyatoo cream sitting around in my pantry for ages with no idea of what to do with them (does anyone else see something new and exciting and buy it without any thought of how on earth they might use it?) so this was pretty much perfect.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKW43piSoHI/AAAAAAAAEds/0Vdn0BPeHFg/s400/IMG_4350.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Next time I think I'd double the amount of caramel filling and half the amount of cream topping but otherwise it was really delicious and simple to make (which is always a bonus when you're running late after your bike gets a puncture on your training ride after you've already got lost and have been out way longer than anticipated as it is).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKW44gNQ9WI/AAAAAAAAEdw/97Tb-hzGVsw/s400/IMG_4353.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Looking forward to doing it all again when I get back. We already have the date scheduled!</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
I could say that eating a late breakfast and checking out earthquake damage was the reason for my trip to Christchurch a couple of weeks back and although that sounds quite wonderful (well, the late breakfast bit does) it's not true. I really went to down south for a race which probably doesn't surprise anyone. We had a long drive ahead of us but that was going to pale in comparison to what we were going to face the following day.</span></span></p>

<p>Continuing along a theme of eating late, since breakfast wasn't eaten until after 11am that meant lunch was late too...4:30 in the afternoon kind of late in fact and consisted of homemade bread slathered in peanut butter and eaten in the supermarket carpark at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=timaru&amp;sll=-36.866443,174.772559&amp;sspn=0.044703,0.072012&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Timaru,+Canterbury,+New+Zealand&amp;ll=-44.398467,171.254883&amp;spn=2.555134,4.608765&amp;z=8"><span><span>Timaru</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAN-pthbsI/AAAAAAAAEVc/9Fj2o6Uz4UM/s400/IMG_4249.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
You're getting a photo of this because M thought it was really quite funny. We couldn't go into the supermarket until I'd eaten because I was so hungry and we were too lazy to go sit in the park to eat (okay let's be honest, I was too desperate for us to stop so I could eat).

<p>Finally we arrived in </p></span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=naseby&amp;sll=-44.398467,170.205688&amp;sspn=2.555134,6.70166&amp;g=Timaru,+Canterbury,+New+Zealand&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Naseby,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;ll=-45.025009,170.145264&amp;spn=1.263794,2.304382&amp;z=9"><span><span>Naseby</span></span></a><span><span> which is one of my favourite places ever. Even better was the fact we were staying in the awesome </span></span><a href="http://www.larchviewholidaypark.co.nz/"><span><span>Naseby holiday park</span></span></a><span><span>...awesome because it is right next to the forest and I </span></span><em><span><span>love</span></span></em><span><span> the forest here.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJA5d1lUVxI/AAAAAAAAEWU/Fnbg2RVqbxw/s400/IMG_4262.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We were tired and a bit hungry by the time we finally arrived so dinner was quick. I fried up a packet of tofu with some mushrooms then added a packet of soup/curry (seriously, it can't decide which one it is supposed to be) and some broccoli. Delicious.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAOAA6WiII/AAAAAAAAEVg/X8tDiYrab_o/s400/IMG_4250.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It really wasn't all that long before we were crawling out of bed again in the morning to get ready for the race...a 12 hour rogaine. If anyone is interested, you can read my writeup of the event </span></span><a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/2010/09/ophir-awesome-epic-12-hour-rogaine.html"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p>It's very unexciting but here is my breakfast before the race - weetbix, tinned fruit salad, soy yogurt and oat milk.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAOC1D9sfI/AAAAAAAAEVo/Q6FEPPCVx5w/s400/IMG_4258.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here is the event centre in </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Ophir,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;sll=-45.025009,170.145264&amp;sspn=1.263794,2.304382&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Ophir,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;ll=-45.15299,169.837646&amp;spn=1.260966,2.304382&amp;z=9"><span><span>Ophir</span></span></a><span><span>...so awesome! We were based out of their town hall which is the building on the right.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7KsZ5lDrI/AAAAAAAAET8/KxdrvNHmoTI/s400/IMG_4264.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
One thing I love about the sports that I do is the amazing countryside that I get to see and explore. I think Central Otago is one of my favourite places and the scenery is just spectacular. I hope to be doing this for as long as I possibly can. My Mum tells the story of a lady in her 90s competing at the World Masters Orienteering Champs one year and I guess that is something that I strive for.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI7KxCJRNBI/AAAAAAAAEUQ/AcOUrVZ-HsM/s400/IMG_3446.JPG" alt="" title="">

So yeah, the scenery was awesome, M and I worked very well as a team (although I wish his legs weren't so long 'cause it is tough work keeping up) and we made it back with 5 minutes to spare which is always good. My feet were absolutely killing me but it was all worth it as we won the mixed grade...oh yeah!

<p>Although I'm sure you're all sick of scenery by now, but I have to finish with a photo looking down over Naseby forest from our walk the following morning...this place is extremely close to my heart.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJA5isgxbGI/AAAAAAAAEWg/rkb6Z_GYhJg/s400/IMG_3505.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

<span><span> <br>
About this time last week I fell asleep at my desk but luckily today I am much more awake! 5:40am flights are not fun.</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, it feels like a lifetime ago now but about a week and a half ago now (?) I flew down to Christchurch for a race in central Otago. 10:30pm is quite possibly the latest I've ever had dinner but my plane didn't land until after 9:30pm and then we had to go pick up some gear from B's house. I think I was getting to the point of wanting to eat my hand by the time we finally got to M's house but it was okay because he had cooked me dinner!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__kG1uXAI/AAAAAAAAEVA/SMiBIKSzn74/s400/IMG_4200.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Homemade bread fresh out of the breadmaker (it was still warm!!) and pumpkin soup!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__lQ9h_oI/AAAAAAAAEVE/zDwaWr8ymN8/s400/IMG_4203.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'd made a double-batch of the Fudgy Wudgy Blueberry Brownies from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/nomicon.html"><span><span>Veganomicon</span></span></a><span><span>...one of the batches went to my brother (because I am an awesome sister!) and the other was technically for M's sister to bribe her into picking him up from the airport the week before but of course we needed to do a taste test first!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAAdEaK1cI/AAAAAAAAEVU/dQLsZ1UPk4Y/s400/IMG_4205_2.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They were so ridiculously sweet and rich that I actually only managed half a piece which is saying something since I can normally finish anything sweet! But then again, it was, like, 11:30pm by then and such a late dinner really screws with my appetite. But in saying that, they were certainly delicious and I hear via the grapevine that M's sister has polished them all off.

<p>Naturally we ended up sleeping in for ages the following morning so I was practically ravenous by the time I awoke. We had planned to go to </p></span></span><a href="http://www.theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span> for breakfast but it was shut due to minor earthquake damage so we trooped off to Cathedral Square and made it to </span></span><a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span> just in time to make their cutoff for the breakfast menu.

<p>First up...drinks. I wish I could remember what my juice was because despite being bright green it was seriously delicious. M ordered some berry smoothie...I just love the bright colours.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__mwDgutI/AAAAAAAAEVI/kwx-QwghDt4/s400/IMG_4217.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I really wanted the Flax-oat French Toast which was really delicious and super filling.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__oYgeG9I/AAAAAAAAEVM/DsxMRww_GoI/s400/IMG_4220.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
M's choice was the Raw Cacoa Crepes (at least I think that's what they were). The crepes were made with cacoa and zucchini apparently and filled with all sorts of fresh fruit.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__pzRpC0I/AAAAAAAAEVQ/G1416jC893A/s400/IMG_4223.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
On first glance I swear the crepes look like they're filled with lollies! But I'll be honest here, we both found the crepes to be far to rich and chocolatey for breakfast (I can't believe I'm saying this!). A single one of these for dessert would be amazing but it was all a bit much for breakfast.

<p>After breakfast (we'd reached midday by then!) we went for a wander around town (or the parts of it we could access) to see some of the earthquake damage. To be honest you couldn't see all that much in town because many of the roads looked like this...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAOP7b4-6I/AAAAAAAAEV0/SVCg4PcES4U/s400/IMG_4235.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There were army trucks and police cars everywhere (this was nearly a week after the first earthquake but Christchurch is still being hit by aftershocks).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAORYS20-I/AAAAAAAAEV4/1skcLenDwzE/s400/IMG_4240.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
When we parked our car to go to breakfast we passed this building below. Its whole roof had collapsed and tried to escape out the window. There are buckled buildings all over the show.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAONlprEvI/AAAAAAAAEVs/SOTQnLijFZI/s400/IMG_4208.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Each building you pass in town has a piece of paper taped to it describing it's current state. You don't want to find one of these red ones on your building.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAWg1k697I/AAAAAAAAEV8/O2GPJVzlanw/s400/IMG_4233.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We didn't head out to the south where a lot of the damage is as we were running a bit late and needing to head off on our journey into central Otago for the weekend. Thankfully I only felt a couple of aftershocks while I was in Christchurch but the low rumbling sound before the house started shaking is really quite scary.

<p>Anyway, this post is already quite long enough so the rest of the adventure will have to wait...</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
I am off on an plane tonight but before I go...</span></span></p>

<p>I made pot pie (or whatever it is you might call it)! Well, actually I've made it several times in various different ways and it has even passed the flatmate test (as in they were still alive the following morning).</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGPBhiYmvOI/AAAAAAAAED0/XUHwPJwm1e8/s400/IMG_4002.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is my first version and the only one I got around to photographing which is rather unfortunate because once it was in the oven I realised I'd forgotten to put the baking powder in the scone top despite putting it out on the table with all the other ingredients! So the following versions looked much cooler. This particular version is filled with leeks, carrot, mushrooms, onion, creamed corn and tofu and topped with a wholemeal scone mixture adapted from </span></span><a href="http://www.vegantable.com/"><span><span>The Vegan Table</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGPBirG_ZHI/AAAAAAAAED4/_kcCbsfGFqc/s400/IMG_4004.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Other versions have involved chickpeas, cannellini beans, courgette, broccoli, cauliflower and any other vegetable in my fridge! Basically you stirfry up the veggies and I add a tin of creamed corn to give it some liquid. Then once they are pretty much cooked I pour the mixture into a casserole dish then whip up a scone topping and drop that on top. Bake in the oven for roughly 20 minutes and there you have it (but be aware...it'll be super hot inside). Perfect food for winter and the cold, wet nights we seem to have right through spring.

<p>Anyway, I'm off...as usual my packing is quite behind schedule! Think of me this weekend as I fly into the <a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/canterbury-earthquake/">earthquake zone</a> and then head off deep into the <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;q=ophir,+otago&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Ophir,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;ll=-45.143305,169.593201&amp;spn=0.315291,0.837708&amp;t=h&amp;z=11">wilderness</a>!</p>

<span><span> <br>
...also known as Sunday in Christchurch.</span></span></p>

<p>We ate porridge, went orienteering (otherwise known as running round in circles and standing round in the freezing cold afterwards), sat in front of the fire and ate peanut butter sandwiches. Oh, and I got asked to do the <a href="http://wrc2010.org.nz/"><span><span>World Rogaine Champs</span></span></a><span><span>. ARGH!!!! Exciting!!!!!! (in case you hadn't worked it out, that was exciting news number 2).</span></span></p>

<p>Moving on. In the afternoon B and I popped into his local mall to, well, do mall stuff (well, actually to go to the supermarket but we got distracted). On our way through I saw this...</p>

<p></p><center><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFojyHbAGiI/AAAAAAAAEBU/yv46CRc2zWQ/s400/IMG_3936.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Personally this could almost be exciting news number 3 but you might laugh at me. Beauty and the Beast is, like, my favourite movie of all time (okay, maybe a close second after <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The Princess Bride</a>). And now it's in 3D!

<p>Anyway, once I'd calmed down from that excitement,  we popped over to visit D at her motel to eat cake...certain celebrations always need cake right?</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokE8pVrvI/AAAAAAAAECE/Nxk_FTLRtvM/s400/IMG_3941.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I like cake (although making them in B's kitchen is not quite so good since it is lacking in some vital equipment so it's lucky I brought my cake pan down with me)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj1uuARGI/AAAAAAAAEBc/i4L5HGB5w4c/s400/IMG_3947.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then for dinner we went to the </span></span><a href="http://www.thedux.co.nz/christchurch/home"><span><span>Dux de Lux</span></span></a><span><span> which is a vegetarian and seafood pub (I think they used to be solely vegetarian but they now serve seafood as well). With heaps of the meals you get a salad on the side (which you get to pick). There were 2 vegan options this time so I went with both...a tofu and vege one and a green salad. The tofu salad was divine.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj2wosQiI/AAAAAAAAEBg/ZREty916MfQ/s400/IMG_3949.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also really like their (alcoholic) ginger beer. You may have noticed I like ginger and since discovering that alcohol, in moderation, is really not that scary, this is a very nice drink.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokGq41U7I/AAAAAAAAECM/JPj91DRABpk/s400/IMG_3951.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We wanted kumara chips but it was not to be (they were sold out) so we settled with buffalo wedges. This plate destroyed us and we left way too many on the plate for my liking but my stomach was just not gonna take any more.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokJpzlI0I/AAAAAAAAECU/BgwyUqqd4AM/s400/IMG_3958.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For my main I ordered the corn and vegetable fritters which are served with a beetroot chutney. I had these last time I was here but I didn't feel like the Indian dish and I can get a red tofu curry up in Auckland any day. Plus I like corn fritters. They were better than I remembered too.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokIHF7YMI/AAAAAAAAECQ/N_B1wq2UBwc/s400/IMG_3956.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
So all in all another pretty much perfect day...</span></span>
