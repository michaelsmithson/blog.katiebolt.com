- <em>Tomorrow, When the War Began</em> by John Marsden</span></p>

<p>After far too many late nights this past weekend (yes, I am a nana and proud of it) I am so tired that all I really want to do is curl up on the couch while watching episodes of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Jonathan_Creek_episodes">Jonathan Creek</a>. I've only seen 3 episodes so far but along with his lying on <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007mf4f">The Unbelievable Truth</a> (he talked about tigers AND managed to smuggle all 5 truths past everyone so he earns extreme points for that alone) I am becoming an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Davies">Alan Davies</a> fan. I get a bit obsessed about things. This might turn out to be one of them.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-4TBGhJR6mQk/TmSe-Y1UW2I/AAAAAAAAFNY/e4Olt4_vu4Q/s400/IMG_2140.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Random photo of a rock to distract you momentarily. Note how they felt that you required a cone to point the rock out in case you missed it. They've gone a bit cone crazy here I think.</em></center> <br>
Right, well today I thought I would tell you about pie. Pie in New Zealand would pretty much automatically mean a meat pie of some kind for most people. I remember when I was a kid my Mum would occasionally buy a supermarket 'family' pie and attempt to cut it into 5 pieces. There would be much argument over who got what bit because the pie was, rather unfortunately, a rectangle and if you got one of the end pieces you basically only got pastry (although this wasn't too bad since that was the only real bit I liked on them).

<p>Anyway (that was quite a tangent...got a bit nostalgic there!), fast-forward to today (or, in reality, a few weeks ago) and I thought I might try my hand at making my very own pie. I've never made a pie before and I'd bought myself a pie dish after getting all excited and buying everything in sight back when we were setting up our flat. This pie is nothing like the pie of my childhood. In fact, it's nothing like any pie I'd ever had before but it was darn tasty. It's a bit of an adaption on the Mushroom, Leek and White Bean Pie from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/vegan-brunch/">Vegan Brunch</a> with my first ever batch of homemade pastry.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-sfkx6Wf5Y3U/Tkitc604sQI/AAAAAAAAFKc/8EKLH_eJ7ak/s400/IMG_2372.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
I didn't have enough mushrooms (or the kind of mushroom it talks about since I've never heard of cremini mushrooms before but fortunately white button mushrooms worked just fine) so I added heaps of onion. It seemed to all work out. But what couldn't when it was encased in rich, melt-in-your-mouth pastry (I think I might have overdosed on the margarine!)? I know the recipe says to leave it at least 30 minutes before serving and that it's best at room temperature but honestly, I thought it was way better hot out of the oven (or hot after being heated up in the oven again) and with a whole lot of my Mum's feijoa and ginger chutney.

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-WYMzqVjkfa8/Tkite3yAwbI/AAAAAAAAFKo/cFfXMe7YvdA/s400/IMG_2381.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
So, I've done the savory pie but it appears that most of the world are used to associating pies with sweet desserts. M's Mum gave us the most ginormous of pumpkins and I was pretty much over eating pumpkin soup and putting it in every meal we had so I thought, since we were heading off to a pot luck, that I'd attempt to make pumpkin pie. I've never had it before (apart from a <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/08/its-all-very-exciting.html">raw version at The Lotus Heart</a>) and decided I'd use the Pump-Can Pie recipe from Kris' <a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/cookbook/">100 Best Vegan Bak­ing Recipes</a>.

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-TKAO3dwjQik/TmScIAJ0sLI/AAAAAAAAFNQ/WI7uR-VRMRc/s400/IMG_2500.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
It seemed to work out okay although I should have actually used the amount of sugar the recipe called for rather than naively thinking it would be too much. It sort of tasted a bit weird but then again, the idea of pumpkin pie seems a bit odd to me. I think I'd rather make it with kumara (which my Dad thought was even more of an odd idea). People did seem to enjoy eating it though, even my friend's little girl who hated the pumpkin in the savoury dish. She ate all her pie but didn't even finish her ice cream!

<p>The last pie, however, is definitely awesome. <a href="http://likeavegan.com.au/2010/09/caramel-cream-pie/">Caramel Cream Pie</a>...with a name like that you can't really go wrong! I have made a variant of it before (using tofu instead of soy cream cheese which is actually probably the best way to go to be honest because then it isn't so mind-blowingly rich) but this time I thought I'd go all the way and see just how many fake dairy products I could use!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-6y_H_fTJajc/TmScIpaqOvI/AAAAAAAAFNU/siK8HhpIr_0/s400/IMG_2508.JPG" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
This pie lasted ages because you could only eat fairly small slivers at a time before feeling ill and like you might need a lie down after the explosion of sweet, rich, fake dairy goodness. Make it now but be prepared for the coma you might find yourself in afterwards!

<p>Right, sorry about all that rambling. I'm tired and my brain is spinning around and drifting off a bit. But go and make some pie. That will make everything better!</p>

<p>I've been thinking about this for a while now. I don't tend to blog much about myself here, trying, attempting to keep it all about food and keep my world (mostly) anonymous. Seemed to make sense to start with but as time has gone by most people (that I know of) know who I am or at least a lot more about me than I blog about. Also sometimes I just don't feel like blogging about food or food and life are often so linked together that it is hard to seperate the two. Plus my brain is always a little scattered and all over the place so I thought I might try something different sometimes.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-FMYyBYPUuUc/TliqvrmgmpI/AAAAAAAAFM8/Tttcwdo2Rt0/s400/IMG_2435.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
<em>Kinda unrelated, but last week we ran to work in the snow because we couldn't get the car out of the street. It was entertaining, especially when we got interviewed by the newspaper partway there...!</em></center> <br>
So to start, and because it's kinda scary, I will tell you five things that aren't related to food.

<ol>
<li>My favourite song is Yellow by Coldplay. It has been for years, probably since the moment I first heard it.  </li>
<li>My favourite colour is yellow. I didn't even think about the fact that my favourite song had the same name until people asked me if that was why I liked the song. All I know is that I love the colour yellow.  </li>
<li>When I was younger I knew all the words to Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Princess Bride.  </li>
<li>I love running or riding up hills. It's the best thing ever. I hate coming back down again with a passion. Bit of a problem when the hill behind our house is massive so the downhill stretches on into eternity.  </li>
<li>I can't spell so spell checks, little squiggly lines under words and google are my best friends (I had to use them to work out how on earth to spell squiggly...you don't even want to know my first attempt). <br>

<em>Top of a mountain (holding on for dear life so I didn't blow away...it was _that</em> windy)? Check. <br>

Anyway, to make everyone feel at home again (myself included), I will let you into my kitchen for some baking. Imagine you have some soy cream and a can of lemonade (Sprite for those of you who aren't kiwi or Australian). What can you make. Obviously you will need some more ingredients like, um, flour, baking powder and sugar but I'm sure you knew what I meant?</li>
</ol>

Scones of course!! Lemonade and cream scones to be exact, from the Alison and Simon Holst <a href="http://www.holst.co.nz/Products/Service/Detail/Product/117/BOOKS/New_Zealand_Bread_Book.html">bread book</a>. Super easy and super delicious. I found I needed more liquid (lemonade) than the recipe called for but I think that's because the cream is thicker. Can't find soy cream (and live in New Zealand)? The <a href="http://www.choosecrueltyfree.org.nz/">Safe</a> shop delivers super fast!

And how does one serve these scones? For a lazy breakfast with more cream and dollops of jam, that's how.

<p>Golly gosh, it's been an age since I've last posted! That snow I mentioned may not have come on Sunday but it sure was around by Monday. So much so that we couldn't get into work. Snow day!!!</p>

I wish I could tell you that I spent the day cooking and baking up a storm to keep us warm but instead I spent most of it on the couch or in bed horribly sick. Thankfully I managed to redeem myself today as snow blanketed the city yet again (I could get used to these long weekends!).

Cooking in my brand new fast slow cooker is a big pot of pumpkin, coconut and lentil soup (to go with five seed loaf from the breadmaker). I hope it works out because the instruction manual did my head in!

<p>M was cutting up part of a huge pumpkin for me to use in the soup but it was too much so I pondered what to do with the extra. In the end I boiled it up and then blended it to make a puree. Half went in the freezer but half went into a ginger and pumpkin loaf which has already been partly devoured. I am trying restrain myself from eating the whole damn thing right now!</p>

<strong>Gingery Pumpkin Bread</strong>
Adapted from a couple of recipes in Kris' <a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/cookbook/">The 100 Best Vegan Baking Recipes</a>.

<p>1 cup white flour <br>
1/2 cup wholemeal flour <br>
1 1/2 tsp baking soda <br>
2 tsp ginger <br>
1 tsp cinnamon <br>
1/2 tsp salt <br>
1 cup pumpkin puree <br>
1/4 cup oil <br>
1/4 cup apple puree <br>
1/2 cup brown sugar <br>
1/4 cup molasses <br>
1/3 cup milk (I used oat milk)</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C. Lightly grease a loaf tin (a smaller one is better since it doesn't get all that big).</p>

<p>In a large bowl mix together the flours, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon and salt. In another bowl whisk the pumpkin puree, oil, apple puree, brown sugar, molasses and milk together until smooth.</p>

<p>Add the wet mixture to the dry ingredients and mix gently until just combined. Spoon into the loaf tin and bake for about 45-50 minutes until, well, done. It might take a tiny bit longer but our oven is fan-forced and I can't figure out how to stop it!</p>

<p>Leave in the tin for at least half an hour before turning out onto a cooling rack.</p>

- <em>Dead Reckoning</em> by Charlaine Harris</span></p>

<p>Right now I am buried deep in boxes after the truck came and dropped off all my stuff from Auckland. SO exciting! I am impatiently waiting for M to find something to prop the front of my bookcase up on (the floor is uneven) so I can unpack all my books. Impatient might be an understatement...</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-frWGDlem1UA/Thjmpl_AgcI/AAAAAAAAFIA/Mx1y6qcRmbA/s400/IMG_2102.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, a couple of weekends ago we invited M’s parents and sister round for dinner which was an awesome excuse to get my hands dirty doing some fun cooking. I really wanted to make bread from scratch which is something I haven’t really done before (apart from making pita bread once which is pretty fun). I had a recipe from my old flatmate which I was keen to try out so on Saturday afternoon I found myself elbow deep in flour! But it was all worth it because the bread came out divine.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-qUb_c020p5c/ThjmraPPocI/AAAAAAAAFIE/mUx9DgagEeQ/s400/IMG_2103.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also really wanted to make corn chowder so I had a array of different ingredients I thought might possibly go in it but no real idea of what I was going to do. This seems to be a common theme of my cooking! I had browsed various recipes but nothing was quite what I wanted so I just made it up as I went along. There is onion, pumpkin, potato, celery, corn, coconut cream, veggie stock, sundried tomatoes, various spices among various other ingredients I can’t remember now. It all seemed too chunky for my liking once it was done though so I bizzed it up a tiny bit with the stick blender so there were still plenty of lumps but nothing too ginormous.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ADIW9kiSIbA/ThjmtKgVLDI/AAAAAAAAFII/k3NZbXm_kv8/s400/IMG_2104.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It ended up turning out delicious and served with the bread I was quite impressed with myself! We ended up eating way too much and getting super full...always a sign of a successful meal. But of course you have to have dessert. I had a whole lot of rhubarb in our freezer which M’s Mum had given us so I stewed that up with some apples and raisins and made a delicious crumble. So all in all it was the perfect winter feast.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-SgB8Gc8XhW8/ThjmuedM0CI/AAAAAAAAFIM/1kKjMfbNG3Q/s400/IMG_2109.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Since then it’s got steadily colder. In fact they reckon there might be snow down to sea level tomorrow...I hope they are wrong! But now I have all my books so I guess it could be worse!</span></span>

- </span></span><em><span><span style="font-size:x-small;">Making Money</span></span></em><span><span><span style="font-size:x-small;"> by Terry Pratchett</span></span></span></p>

<p>I have tried to write this post so many times but it never comes out right or I think no one would be interested or it just ends up so long and twisty that I give up. But in the end I thought perhaps you might be more interested than I thought or that at least sometimes it is helpful so say what you need to say (even if it bores everyone else to tears)...</p>

<p>Last Monday started out like any other day. It didn't stay that way however. It was just after 1pm when we got the first big earthquake (a 5.6 I think) which had us diving under our desks. It wasn't long after we'd all managed to calm down and get back to work again that the 6.3 struck. The sounds are the most frightening to me. The groaning and grumbling of the earthquake itself, the collective holding of breath (which has a sound presence that is impossible to explain), panicked screaming, the rattling of, well, everything...and then the silence. That small moment of time feels like a lifetime. Then everything else gets broken down into tiny segments of memories.</p>

<p>I remember the terrible smell of chlorine spilling out of the cracks that formed in the spa pool outside. I remember seeing the birds flying manically through the sky in all sorts of directions and in huge flocks. I remember eating handfuls of licorice allsorts that the boss had taken out of his freezer (and wondering why he would keep them in there), not caring they weren't vegan. I just wanted something.</p>

<p>I remember drinking fancy wine out of a fancy glass while sitting outside in my fluro bike jacket and my helmet.  I remember needing to use the bathroom but not knowing what I was supposed to do so just waiting and waiting. I remember our company director lifting my bike over the security fence which we couldn't get open because it needed power. I remember biking slowly through the park in an attempt to not to get sprayed by the liquefaction but wishing I could bike faster because I had visions of trees falling on me. I remember the dust and the queues of cars and getting lost on my way home when I found I couldn't take my usual route. I remember the poor lady at the traffic lights who spoke like someone had taken the bottom out of her world but that I just wanted to get away from her and the doom and gloom and get home.</p>

<p>I remember sitting in a doorframe near the front door at home worried about M because I couldn't get hold of him (despite knowing he would be fine) and holding my cellphone really tight in the hope that someone might magically realise I needed some company. And then just as it was becoming unbearable there was a knock on the door and our neighbour, who I'd never met, was there asking me if I was okay and if I wanted to come over to his house until people got home. I remember listening to his windup radio and being unable to sit still while he calmly cleaned up the mess in his kitchen.</p>

<p>I remember the relief to see familiar faces as everyone came home or popped over to make sure we were all okay. I remember the power coming on just after dark and sitting inside, still in my fluro jacket, watching the news on our warped television screen. I remember not wanting to be alone and wanting to keep everyone here I cared about in the room with me. I remember wondering how it was possible to be so tired but so unable to sleep. I remember crying and wondering why. I remember being alive. It was never in doubt that M and I would be okay but the magical feeling of surviving is amazing.</p>

<p>Anyway, in case you have managed to read down this far I do have something for you...on the day before the earthquakes I made myself an oatmeal cake for breakfast before going orienteering. It was super delicious, especially with soy yoghurt and because I am awesome I even have a recipe for you (based on the ones <a href="http://chocolatecoveredkatie.com/2010/11/11/check-out-my-oatmeal-cake/"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>).</span></span></p>

1/2 cup wholegrain oats <br>
a pinch of salt <br>
1/2 tsp cinnamon <br>
1/4 tsp ginger <br>
1/2 a banana, mashed <br>
3 Tbsp oat milk (well, any non-dairy milk) <br>
1/2 Tbsp oil <br>
1 Tbsp golden syrup <br>
2 Tbsp peanut butter (or other nut butter) <br>
1 small handful of chopped walnuts <br>
1 small handful raisins (or chopped dates or something similar if you don't like raisins)

<p>Preheat the oven to 190°C.</p>

<p>Combine the dry ingredients, then mix in the wet ingredients.</p>

<p>Spoon into a greased ramekin (about 1 cup I think) and cook for about 20-25 minutes until it's firm(ish).</p>

<p>Let sit for about 5 minutes then tip out onto your plate and hope for the best (you may need to run a knife around the side)!</p></span></span>

</span></span><em><span><span style="font-size:x-small;">(and yes, that is the entirety of chapter 29)</span></span></em><span> <br>
<span> <br>
Look! It's me! I'm still alive!</span></span></p>

<p>Seriously, I have all these half-finished posts that haven't made it up because, well, I've ended up super super busy. Life can do that to you sometimes.</p>

<p>On my bench at the moment I have a whole lot of lemon shortbread cookies cooling for our work morning tea tomorrow. We are having a British themed morning since it's Queens Birthday this long weekend in New Zealand (it's not actually the Queen's birthday since that's in April sometime I think, but this is when we celebrate it). No photos of them yet but they do taste super delicious even slightly warm and still a bit soft!</p>

<p>But I do have cookies for you today. Even a recipe. This is an adaption of a recipe my old flatmate would make all the time. She would try all these different versions and we'd all get to taste test them. I was feeling a little homesick the day I made these and it cheered me up thinking heaps.</p>

<p>Anyway, I also made them the day before this crazy 24 race (eventually there will be a post for this and many others <a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/">here</a> when i come up for air again) the weekend after I arrived so I could have something yummy to eat in between legs and to warm my heart when the rest of me was freezing (and grumpy)!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-C6R6SPpRdFM/TedidQORo_I/AAAAAAAAFFo/FethbUeRFSk/s400/IMG_1711.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ate at least 10 on the first day of the race (and a few more on the following day although I was slightly over cookies by then).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TdGtj8DD3lI/AAAAAAAAFEY/FU8uOAwMZIE/s400/IMG_1681.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
</span></span><strong><span><span>HyunJin's Magical Cookies</span></span></strong><span><span> (my chocolate, walnut and sultana version) <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>I got about 24 quite large cookies out of this recipe...and they are far yummier than they look!</span></span></em><span><span>

<p>2/3 cup vegan margarine (I used olivani or whatever it's called) <br>
1 scant cup brown sugar <br>
2 Tbsp golden syrup <br>
1 1/2 cups flour <br>
1 1/2 cups oats <br>
1 1/2 tsp baking powder <br>
pinch of salt <br>
80g chopped walnuts <br>
1/2 cup sultanas (or raisins or currants or chopped dates etc) <br>
1/2 cup dark chocolate, chopped</p>

<p>Preheat the oven to 170°C. Line a couple of trays with baking paper.</p>

<p>Slowly melt the margarine, sugar and golden syrup in a big pot over the stove. Take the pot off the heat and mix in the flour, oats, baking powder and salt. Stir in the walnuts, sultanas and chocolate.</p>

<p>Place spoonfuls of mixture onto the baking trays with a bit of space between each. Lightly flatten (not too much). Bake for, hmmm, about 12 minutes or something like that. Just don't overdo them. That's all!!</p>
