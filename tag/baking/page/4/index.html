<span><span> <br>
I go to Australia at the end of this week! I would be excited except for the fact that I'm terrified. You see, this is what happened last weekend when I was out training...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKfnHOUqvgI/AAAAAAAAEeE/NEDZX4WV918/s400/IMG_4362.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and I'd had to climb up several metres in order to take this photo! The general consensus among some of my friends is that my mountain bike has gotten jealous of my road bike and decided it would throw me off just to make sure I knew who was boss. I ended up with mild concussion and head trauma. Thanks.

<p>Anyway, we will worry about the racing when I get there and instead I will show you the delicious dinner party I had with a couple of friends the other night.</p>

<p>J made some awesome roast veggies (kumara, potato, carrot and pumpkin). You can't really go wrong there.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pdYZlYwI/AAAAAAAAEfA/UC-o4Uv89_c/s400/IMG_4343.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Our beautiful host made a big pot of vermicelli noodle stir-fry with heaps of veggies and flavoured with soy sauce, sesame oil and ginger.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pe_CbNSI/AAAAAAAAEfE/KI8H_eGdqdc/s400/IMG_4344.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here is my plate (oh okay, my first plate 'cause let's be honest, it was really good and I was really hungry).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TK0pglVnGcI/AAAAAAAAEfI/ylSAb6XDoHQ/s400/IMG_4345.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was in charge of dessert and after wondering what to make for ages I ended up making the </span></span><a href="http://veganzestforlife.blogspot.com/2010/09/caramel-cream-pie-oo-la-la.html"><span><span>Caramel Cream Pie</span></span></a><span><span> from Alice's </span></span><a href="http://veganzestforlife.blogspot.com/"><span><span>blog</span></span></a><span><span>. You see, I'd had a tin of this soy condensed milk and a packet of the soyatoo cream sitting around in my pantry for ages with no idea of what to do with them (does anyone else see something new and exciting and buy it without any thought of how on earth they might use it?) so this was pretty much perfect.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKW43piSoHI/AAAAAAAAEds/0Vdn0BPeHFg/s400/IMG_4350.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Next time I think I'd double the amount of caramel filling and half the amount of cream topping but otherwise it was really delicious and simple to make (which is always a bonus when you're running late after your bike gets a puncture on your training ride after you've already got lost and have been out way longer than anticipated as it is).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKW44gNQ9WI/AAAAAAAAEdw/97Tb-hzGVsw/s400/IMG_4353.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Looking forward to doing it all again when I get back. We already have the date scheduled!</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Very slowly, Glenda raised her right hand into a fist and lowered it into her mouth, and bit down very hard in an attempt to somehow retrieve the last fifteen minutes from the records of the universe and replace them with something far less embarrassing, like her knickers falling down. <br>
- </span></span><em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Unseen Academicals</span></span></em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> by Terry Pratchett</span></span>
<span><span> <br>
The other day I told M I was a domestic goddess. That may have been a slight exaggeration but I did venture into the kitchen to do a spot of baking (and do my chores for the week). There is nothing like the smell of fresh baking wafting through the house (nothing except eating said baking). The other morning I actually woke up to the confusing smell of chocolate brownies and fresh bread as my flatmate had stayed up all night baking as an attempt to procrastinate from his study...awesome!</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, it was my Mum's birthday that night and what do all birthdays call for? Let's see...um, CAKE! This is a chocolate crumb cake. It is SO good and got much love from the family.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKP7dhDxD_I/AAAAAAAAEdY/o_pxFaenFpo/s400/IMG_4315.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here is my (first) slice. We all went back for seconds (and were all tempted by thirds but one doesn't want to overdo these things </span></span><em><span><span>too</span></span></em><span><span> much).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TKP7fJgJnQI/AAAAAAAAEdg/oSHZaf9Z7ec/s400/IMG_4324.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then, because I am awesome, I whipped up a batch of chewy oatmeal-raisin cookies (from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/nomicon.html"><span><span>Veganomicon</span></span></a><span><span>) for my cousin who was chained to her desk writing her masters paper and for M who lives in Christchurch which is enough of a reason by itself but a while ago he sent me my favourite ginger crunch in the mail (for those interested, yes I will post a recipe once I get something even close to as good as this).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJ2v7WIDV2I/AAAAAAAAEcM/nD5eNdq2xB4/s400/IMG_0001.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They were really quite good and because of M you actually get a photo because I'd eaten and given away all the cookies by the time I realised I still didn't have a photo of them. Thankfully (or perhaps not but in this case it worked in my favour) the post down to Christchurch is pretty slow so he hadn't eaten all of them by the time I hounded him to take some photos. His camera is much better than mine. Perhaps I should steal it.</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
About this time last week I fell asleep at my desk but luckily today I am much more awake! 5:40am flights are not fun.</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, it feels like a lifetime ago now but about a week and a half ago now (?) I flew down to Christchurch for a race in central Otago. 10:30pm is quite possibly the latest I've ever had dinner but my plane didn't land until after 9:30pm and then we had to go pick up some gear from B's house. I think I was getting to the point of wanting to eat my hand by the time we finally got to M's house but it was okay because he had cooked me dinner!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__kG1uXAI/AAAAAAAAEVA/SMiBIKSzn74/s400/IMG_4200.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Homemade bread fresh out of the breadmaker (it was still warm!!) and pumpkin soup!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__lQ9h_oI/AAAAAAAAEVE/zDwaWr8ymN8/s400/IMG_4203.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'd made a double-batch of the Fudgy Wudgy Blueberry Brownies from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/nomicon.html"><span><span>Veganomicon</span></span></a><span><span>...one of the batches went to my brother (because I am an awesome sister!) and the other was technically for M's sister to bribe her into picking him up from the airport the week before but of course we needed to do a taste test first!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAAdEaK1cI/AAAAAAAAEVU/dQLsZ1UPk4Y/s400/IMG_4205_2.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They were so ridiculously sweet and rich that I actually only managed half a piece which is saying something since I can normally finish anything sweet! But then again, it was, like, 11:30pm by then and such a late dinner really screws with my appetite. But in saying that, they were certainly delicious and I hear via the grapevine that M's sister has polished them all off.

<p>Naturally we ended up sleeping in for ages the following morning so I was practically ravenous by the time I awoke. We had planned to go to </p></span></span><a href="http://www.theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span> for breakfast but it was shut due to minor earthquake damage so we trooped off to Cathedral Square and made it to </span></span><a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span> just in time to make their cutoff for the breakfast menu.

<p>First up...drinks. I wish I could remember what my juice was because despite being bright green it was seriously delicious. M ordered some berry smoothie...I just love the bright colours.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__mwDgutI/AAAAAAAAEVI/kwx-QwghDt4/s400/IMG_4217.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I really wanted the Flax-oat French Toast which was really delicious and super filling.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__oYgeG9I/AAAAAAAAEVM/DsxMRww_GoI/s400/IMG_4220.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
M's choice was the Raw Cacoa Crepes (at least I think that's what they were). The crepes were made with cacoa and zucchini apparently and filled with all sorts of fresh fruit.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TI__pzRpC0I/AAAAAAAAEVQ/G1416jC893A/s400/IMG_4223.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
On first glance I swear the crepes look like they're filled with lollies! But I'll be honest here, we both found the crepes to be far to rich and chocolatey for breakfast (I can't believe I'm saying this!). A single one of these for dessert would be amazing but it was all a bit much for breakfast.

<p>After breakfast (we'd reached midday by then!) we went for a wander around town (or the parts of it we could access) to see some of the earthquake damage. To be honest you couldn't see all that much in town because many of the roads looked like this...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAOP7b4-6I/AAAAAAAAEV0/SVCg4PcES4U/s400/IMG_4235.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There were army trucks and police cars everywhere (this was nearly a week after the first earthquake but Christchurch is still being hit by aftershocks).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAORYS20-I/AAAAAAAAEV4/1skcLenDwzE/s400/IMG_4240.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
When we parked our car to go to breakfast we passed this building below. Its whole roof had collapsed and tried to escape out the window. There are buckled buildings all over the show.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAONlprEvI/AAAAAAAAEVs/SOTQnLijFZI/s400/IMG_4208.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Each building you pass in town has a piece of paper taped to it describing it's current state. You don't want to find one of these red ones on your building.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TJAWg1k697I/AAAAAAAAEV8/O2GPJVzlanw/s400/IMG_4233.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We didn't head out to the south where a lot of the damage is as we were running a bit late and needing to head off on our journey into central Otago for the weekend. Thankfully I only felt a couple of aftershocks while I was in Christchurch but the low rumbling sound before the house started shaking is really quite scary.

<p>Anyway, this post is already quite long enough so the rest of the adventure will have to wait...</p></span></span>

            <p></p><p><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>Time, unfortunately, though it makes animals and vegetables bloom and fade with amazing punctuality, has no such simple effect upon the mind of man. The mind of man, moreover, works with equal strangeness upon the body of time. An hour, once it lodges in the queer element of the human spirit, may be stretched to fifty or a hundred times its clock length; on the other hand, an hour may be accurately represented on the timepiece of the mind by one second. <br>

<span><span> <br>
It was D's birthday recently and birthdays are important and need to be celebrated. Don't think about it as getting older (we're only as old as we feel anyway). Think about it as celebrating another year of being alive. Being alive is really quite underrated and trust me, it is definitely something worth celebrating.</span></span></p>

<p>We were going to have a little party a couple of days later but on the actual day I took her out for dinner at <a href="http://www.revive.co.nz/"><span><span>Revive</span></span></a><span><span>. No one should spend their birthday alone.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THG57sFFwFI/AAAAAAAAEJI/I-qnaB9diG0/s400/IMG_4078.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is their hotpot of the day, the Tangy Tandoori Chickpeas which was served on brown rice and I chose the Juicy Bangkok Slaw for my salad. I love their slaws and this was a pretty good hotpot. I was starving so it really hit the spot.

<p>Then a couple of days later we had a little party at D's parents. Aunty L loves creating platters...</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THG59IIH2yI/AAAAAAAAEJM/gp-3U9L7WGI/s400/IMG_4080.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The dip was a spicy red bean dip from one of Alison and Simon Holst's Meals Without Meat books. I could have probably eaten the entire contents (this may have partly been because I was really rather hungry by then). I restrained myself but it was very good.

<p>Everyone else was eating my Aunty's seafood chowder but she had whipped me up some kind of veggie and lentil casserole and it was pretty good. I ate it with more corn chips and the remaining veggies from the platter.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THR8KcDlkZI/AAAAAAAAEKA/M7s07ao_yI0/s400/IMG_4098.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And then we had cake...which is really the main event when it comes to birthday food. I seem to have found my place within our family as the birthday cake maker. I'm not complaining (for a start, if I make it then I know I can eat it and I like cake so getting to eat it is a real bonus!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THG5-e7SceI/AAAAAAAAEJQ/dPwI2uZ3XrQ/s400/IMG_4088.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We are quite good at polishing off a cake in our family. Life is far too short for tiny slivers.

I do think this photo might be a tad deceptive. I swear the icing wasn't </span></span><em><span><span>that</span></span></em><span><span> thick!</span></span>

<p>We ate porridge, went orienteering (otherwise known as running round in circles and standing round in the freezing cold afterwards), sat in front of the fire and ate peanut butter sandwiches. Oh, and I got asked to do the <a href="http://wrc2010.org.nz/"><span><span>World Rogaine Champs</span></span></a><span><span>. ARGH!!!! Exciting!!!!!!

Personally this could almost be exciting news number 3 but you might laugh at me. Beauty and the Beast is, like, my favourite movie of all time (okay, maybe a close second after <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/">The Princess Bride</a>). And now it's in 3D!

<p>Anyway, once I'd calmed down from that excitement,  we popped over to visit D at her motel to eat cake...certain celebrations always need cake right?</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokE8pVrvI/AAAAAAAAECE/Nxk_FTLRtvM/s400/IMG_3941.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I like cake (although making them in B's kitchen is not quite so good since it is lacking in some vital equipment so it's lucky I brought my cake pan down with me)!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj1uuARGI/AAAAAAAAEBc/i4L5HGB5w4c/s400/IMG_3947.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then for dinner we went to the </span></span><a href="http://www.thedux.co.nz/christchurch/home"><span><span>Dux de Lux</span></span></a><span><span> which is a vegetarian and seafood pub (I think they used to be solely vegetarian but they now serve seafood as well). With heaps of the meals you get a salad on the side (which you get to pick). There were 2 vegan options this time so I went with both...a tofu and vege one and a green salad. The tofu salad was divine.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj2wosQiI/AAAAAAAAEBg/ZREty916MfQ/s400/IMG_3949.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I also really like their (alcoholic) ginger beer. You may have noticed I like ginger and since discovering that alcohol, in moderation, is really not that scary, this is a very nice drink.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokGq41U7I/AAAAAAAAECM/JPj91DRABpk/s400/IMG_3951.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We wanted kumara chips but it was not to be (they were sold out) so we settled with buffalo wedges. This plate destroyed us and we left way too many on the plate for my liking but my stomach was just not gonna take any more.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokJpzlI0I/AAAAAAAAECU/BgwyUqqd4AM/s400/IMG_3958.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For my main I ordered the corn and vegetable fritters which are served with a beetroot chutney. I had these last time I was here but I didn't feel like the Indian dish and I can get a red tofu curry up in Auckland any day. Plus I like corn fritters. They were better than I remembered too.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokIHF7YMI/AAAAAAAAECQ/N_B1wq2UBwc/s400/IMG_3956.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
So all in all another pretty much perfect day...</span></span>

            <p></p><p><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">I was waiting for the other shoe to drop. I was waiting for that moment - you know the one I mean - the moment when your date suddenly confesses to something you just can't stomach: he reveals himself as a racist or homophobe, admits he'd never marry anyone but another Baptist (Southerner, brunette, marathon runner, whatever), tells you about his children by his first three wives, describes his fondness for being paddled, or relates his youthful experiences in blowing up frogs or torturing cats. After that moment, no matter how much fun you have, you know it's not going anywhere. <br>
- </span></span><em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;">Definitely Dead</span></span></em><span><span style="font-size: x-small;"> by Charlaine Harris</span></span>
<span><span> <br>
Some days I just want to spend all day in the kitchen...like I'm having a fantasy about being a (not so desperate) housewife. Odd, since I don't want to be a wife, or stuck at home in the kitchen instead of working or adventuring. But I do like being in the kitchen.</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, it's these sort of days which are perfect for cooking up a storm and stocking up the pantry, the fridge and the freezer. First up we have a big batch of stewed fruit which I use on my breakfasts.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TEUJRSrMbFI/AAAAAAAAD9E/ND5AOkE6i_E/s400/IMG_3801.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It's always a little different but this particular batch contained 2 x 1.5(ish)kg bags of organic granny smith apples (oh how I love having Harvest Wholefoods so close), a few handfuls of frozen mixed berries and about a cup of organic raisins...oh, and a dash of vanilla along with a good shake of cinnamon. This freezes really well too.

<p>Next up was a giant batch of muesli (well, as giant as the oven dish would allow...it made 2 big containers full). Apparently muesli is granola. Is that correct? I don't know. We always call it muesli.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TEUJSaT0XqI/AAAAAAAAD9I/dsTH8FLAhPY/s400/IMG_3805.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Hmmm, what's in it? I just tend to throw in what I have but I think it's got wholegrain oats, rye oats, rolled oats, some other kind of oats I can't remember (maybe buckwheat?), shredded coconut, sunflower seeds, sesame seeds, pumpkin seeds, almonds, cashews, brazil nuts and hazelnuts baked with a drizzle of molasses and a big spoonful of coconut oil. Once cooked and cooled I added ground flaxseed and dried fruit consisting of (I think) dates, pineapple, apricots and raisins (or were they sultanas? I can't remember).

<p>There really is nothing like homemade muesli...I'm serious. Plus you can't really go wrong. Just don't talk on the phone while it's cooking 'cause you might forget about it. Luckily one of my flatmates was paying attention! Chuck in what you've got. I have a habit of finding stuff in my pantry and then emptying out the entire packet.</p>

<p>I also made my awesome muesli bars which I have before training every morning. They are SO good (an old flatmate once proclaimed them the best muesli bars they'd ever tried). Again, I just use what I have on hand but you can see one variant of my recipe </p></span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/09/fueling-up.html"><span><span>here</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span>
