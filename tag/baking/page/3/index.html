<span><span> <br>
I know, I know. Blah blah blah...</span></span></p>

<p>Anyway, before I race off to bed (before racing off before dawn tomorrow for the national orienteering champs in Hawkes Bay...scary!!) I thought I'd just quickly tell you something. <a href="http://nomnomnomblog.com/">Kris's</a> new vegan cake book is out and it's called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Have-Your-Cake-Vegan-Too/dp/1569759200/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1298783676&amp;sr=8-1"><span><span>have your cake and vegan too</span></span></a></em><span><span>. It arrived in the mail at my parents the other day which was super exciting!! I was a tester for it so I can tell you that it is awesome. Actually, her cake recipes are pretty much the only ones I ever use.</span></span></p>

<p>I whipped up one I hadn't tried for my cousin's birthday last weekend, Bubbie's Chubby Tuxedo Cake. It seemed fitting after how much she adored <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/04/its-like-ground-almonds-but-with-oreos.html"><span><span>last year's cake</span></span></a><span><span> (the oreos got her very excited).</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Ta_93prSAhI/AAAAAAAAFBs/_W9l7uxn04M/s400/DSC02016.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
As usual for Kris's recipes it was simple, reliable and worked out perfectly (well, it took a bit longer to cook in our ancient oven and my baking always seems to turn out a bit more moist...not that anyone would complain about that).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Ta_94Q1Mv1I/AAAAAAAAFBw/kqyCCvnJxc8/s400/DSC02025.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It went down a treat and my flatmates gave the leftovers I brought home 5 stars (5 michelin stars actually!). Awesome :)

<p>Anyway, I promise to post more once life settles down and I also promise to post about my exciting (terrifying) news soon!! Oh, and if you were wondering about the title watch <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNjcuZ-LiSY">this</a>.</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
So...I'm getting quite bad at this blogging thing and right now things are feeling more than a little stressful which is all rather understandable but doesn't change the fact that I have a whole lot of friends trying to live in a city that pretty much resembles a war zone. But I did have a beautiful weekend. M managed to fly up from Christchurch on Friday night (he requested that I bring water and food to the airport - just a hint at how desperate things are </span></span><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake"><span><span>down there</span></span></a><span><span>) and was quite excited about having a shower since his place was still without water. After M showered and we had dinner we escaped up to my beach house for the weekend.</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7vWZmu5yI/AAAAAAAAE44/yERIufm5aPA/s400/110226_135310.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Somehow Auckland managed to turn on a beautiful fine weekend with no rain whatsoever which is a bit of a miracle! After lazying about and sleeping in (felt like the first time in ages) and going for a paddle on our archaic (but totally awesome) polystyrene surfboards and swimming I made us lunch...hummus, tomato and mushroom toasted sandwiches with a red cabbage coleslaw (recipe to come).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7vW3NAtjI/AAAAAAAAE48/RgBa_px7VQs/s400/110226_141607.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
After lunch we did a bit more lazing about because we could and then wandered up the hill for some fresh air. The view from the top is always incredible (not that the view from out our front door isn't though!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7xcPQT9EI/AAAAAAAAE5g/MyVc_0lK4DA/s640/110226_164528%20Panorama.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then I made us an awesome green curry packed full of veggies, chickpeas and butter beans (my new favourite bean) on brown rice. We both went back for seconds.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7vcA86gxI/AAAAAAAAE5A/6nhTr4GCNlw/s400/110226_191752.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I actually had some bananas I hadn't got around to eating or freezing (this is quite rare since I normally pretty much buy bananas, deliberately leave them on the bench for a couple of days and then freeze to make smoothies) so I decided I was going to make us banana bread. The one from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/veganomicon-the-ultimate-vegan-cookbook/"><span><span>Veganmicon</span></span></a><span><span> to be specific. I think I've got it down pat now and it's my favourite. It even toasts quite well a couple of days later too.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7vdKLgmMI/AAAAAAAAE5E/6x35W9wV0sc/s400/110226_212120.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
We had a slice each for dessert straight from the oven and then pretty much devoured the rest the following day. SO good! Of course, we needed delicious banana bread to fuel us for a run in the hot sun over in Tawharanui...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TW7veldzefI/AAAAAAAAE5M/Gnf5ohgQOwk/s400/110227_094149.jpg" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>Apparently I am in this photo as a tiny wee pink dot halfway up the hill but I am too small to really make out</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
And then all too quickly it was time to go home again and for M to head back to Christchurch. It felt even harder than normal to see him go...</span></span>

Things have been busy and now things are just plain </span></span><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/christchurch-earthquake?label=Christchurch+quake"><span><span>overwhelming and scary</span></span></a><span><span>. It all seems so surreal. Everyone I know in Christchurch is okay but that doesn't really make it that much better. I can't help worrying about M and all my friends. I just want them here and safe. Makes being at work seem completely irrelevant.</span></span></p>

<p>But you've got to try and keep your spirits up so here is the cake I made for a combined birthday party we had in Christchurch a few weeks ago for M and our friends.</p>

</span></span><em><span><span>This is before the cake made it to the party hence the awesome kitchen bench background</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
We ran around outside doing a crazy orienteering course, we ate lots of delicious food and even more delicious cake and we danced to awesome 80s music until I was too tired to stand up any more. Beautiful memories.</span></span>

I have a thing for peppermint chocolate so it wasn't surprising that </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/11/am-i-ever-home.html"><span><span>I fell instantly in love with Revel's mint slice</span></span></a><span><span>.

</span></span><strong><span><span>Mint Slice</span></span></strong><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Base</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
125g margarine, room temperature <br>
1 cup brown sugar <br>
1 cup flour <br>
1 tsp baking powder <br>
1/4 cup cocoa <br>
1 cup coconut thread

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Mint Filling</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
3 Tbsp margarine, room temperature <br>
3 cups icing sugar, sifted <br>
1/4-1/2 tsp peppermint essence <br>
1-2 Tbsp milk (oat, soy, rice etc)

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Chocolate topping</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
250g (1 block) Whittaker's Ghana Peppermint Chocolate (or any block of chocolate really but I only had this one on hand...) <br>
1 Tbsp margarine

<p>Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line a 20 x 20cm square baking tin with baking paper.</p>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Base</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Cream together the margarine and brown sugar until fluffy. Beat in the rest of the ingredients until just combined and then press into the prepared baking tin. Bake for about 15-20 minutes. Let cool.

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Mint Filling</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Beat the margarine until light and fluffy and then slowly add the icing sugar whilst beating. Add the peppermint essence and milk until you reach your desired consistency. Spread the filling over the top of the cooled base.

<p>Melt the chocolate and the margarine together and then spread gently over the mint filling. Chill until firm enough to cut into slices (about 20 pieces...).</p>

<p>Eat.</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
Well here I am, up far too late cooking black beans because I, well, didn't get on to it earlier! I also just pulled a loaf of banana bread (the one from <a href="http://www.theppk.com/books/veganomicon-the-ultimate-vegan-cookbook/">Veganomicon</a> if you were interested) out of the oven and am now procrastinating writing this post while I gchat with M. You see, life has been a little crazy lately. Oh fine, my life is always crazy...but I love it!!</span></span></p>

<p>So basically, it's been a couple of weeks since I got back from Christchurch but I still haven't told you about our awesome dinner at <a href="http://thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span>...because you can't really go down there and not have a fine dining experience!</span></span></p>

<p>We got a starter to share which, because I am a bit bossy, I chose...cashew cheese and crackers. The menu describes it as house cured cashew cheese served with grapes and rosemary almond flax crackers and it's raw!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiSxiN3QI/AAAAAAAAEpc/V2B_sFopXc0/s400/101118_184701.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
SO good. I just wish you got more. I loved the cashew cheese. It was so creamy and awesome! Of course, I had to get their ginger beer because it is truly awesome as well...I need some new words to describe all the awesomeness!!!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiT_ommJI/AAAAAAAAEpg/h3Ey-kGpQc8/s400/101118_185947.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For our mains we got a couple of dishes to share. I've pretty much tried everything on the vegan menu so they weren't anything new but that doesn't make them any more delicious. First up, the Portobello Magic which is portobello mushrooms served on golden brown potato rosti with wilted greens and grilled vegetables (I stole that description from the menu too!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiVMp7P5I/AAAAAAAAEpk/lBRyR8I_VbA/s400/101118_190521.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It is so ridiculously filling and delicious although perhaps a little overboard on the orange sauce. And then we had to get pizza...the veganio pizza in fact with its delicious cashew nut aioli. They clearly work magic with cashews here.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiWgqbF9I/AAAAAAAAEpo/jcxI0eOspi8/s400/101118_190528.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, I almost wished we'd got the large size so we could have taken the leftovers home. I love pizza! But you can't come all the way to The Lotus Heart and not have dessert. I mean, there is more than one vegan option on the menu! In fact, there are, like, 3 (out of 4) vegan options!!! First up, (raw) banana-nut pie with raw vegan ice cream.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiX38JsiI/AAAAAAAAEps/o7i6DoiqNIc/s400/101118_194010.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I remember ordering something of the same name here a couple of years ago and it being okay but this time it was incredible. And there is no words to describe how good this raw ice cream was. We also got a slice of vegan chocolate cake, also served with the rather incredible ice cream.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TPMiZ_B5JrI/AAAAAAAAEpw/QWGK7oX6MSs/s400/101118_194020.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I love cake! Anyway, basically The Lotus Heart makes the most awesomest of food and I can't wait for my summer holiday and the next trip there.</span></span>

So you want to make your own ginger crunch? So you want it to be awesome? So you want it to be so gingery that it knocks your socks off?</span></span></p>

<p>We went to a potluck round the road last night and poor M had to carry steaming hot vegan lasagna fresh out of the oven. It was delicious so therefore worth his hard work.</p>

<p>Anyway, back to talking about ginger, being the awesome person that I am, I had made a super gingery ginger crunch, braving the use of the oven despite ridiculously hot temperatures (what was with that? It's back to being grey and cool today). I still think I can make a better ginger crunch (I've mainly been focused on the icing and not the base which needs some work since it's mostly just the Edmonds version) but here we go since <a href="http://wayfaringchocolate.com/"><span><span>some people</span></span></a><span><span> have been getting impatient!</span></span></p>

</span></span><strong><span><span>Ginger Crunch</span></span></strong><span><span>*

<p>125g vegan margarine, softened (</p></span></span><a href="http://www.blogger.com/www.olivani.co.nz/"><span><span>olivani</span></span></a><span><span> is good) <br>
1/2 cup sugar <br>
1 1/2 cups flour <br>
1 tsp baking powder <br>
2 tsp ground ginger

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Ginger Icing</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
150g vegan margarine <br>
2 Tbsp ground ginger** <br>
7 Tbsp golden syrup <br>
3 cups icing sugar <br>
crystalised ginger, chopped

<p>Cream the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy (or as long as you can be bothered especially if you only have egg beaters which are tedious). Sift the flour, baking powder and ground ginger together and mix into the creamed mixture. You might want to use your hands to get it all mixed in nicely. Press the mixture into a greased 20 x 20cm cake tin or something similar. Bake at 190C for about 20 minutes or until light brown. Just try not to overcook the edges as I did. Top with ginger icing as per below...</p>

<p></p></span></span><em><span><span>Ginger Icing</span></span></em><span><span> <br>
Melt the margarine, ground ginger, golden syrup and icing sugar together in a saucepan and mix well. Then pour over the base and sprinkle the crystalised ginger over the top (it will sort of sink into the icing). Chill until firm before cutting into pieces (a hot knife works best). I cut mine into about 20 pieces<em>*</em> but then again I was trying to feed the masses at the potluck.

<p>Eat.</p>

<p>*It's pretty hard to get this recipe wrong...let's just say I was baking in a kitchen where I couldn't find any measuring cups or scales so I improvised. It worked out fine.
<strong>Just as a note, New Zealand tablespoons (Tbsp) are 15ml whereas I think Australian ones are 20ml.
*</strong>This way you can eat several pieces without feeling bad! Not that you should feel bad anyway...ginger is good for the stomach.</p></span></span>
