Life is amazing. Hell, even when it's tough it's still pretty amazing. Here are some cool things and great food in my life recently...</span></span></p>

<p>Ginger crunch.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGPBqVJhsGI/AAAAAAAAEEU/yF-Ys4fYC-8/s400/IMG_4000.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Even better is getting home from a long day at work to find a parcel sitting outside my bedroom door...a parcel containing my favourite ginger crunch all the way from <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/search?q=soul+food">Soul Food</a> in Christchurch. Awesome!

<p>Riding my bikes.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THc7rq-axtI/AAAAAAAAEN0/uBfD6lrJx5M/s400/IMG_4108.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is my new road bike (I've called her Ellie...interesting to note that my mountain bike is definitely male in my eyes but my road bike is a female)!!! She's shiny and fast!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THc7aE8SjkI/AAAAAAAAENg/79U8L5CQ8X4/s400/IMG_3163.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And here's my mountain bike. He's strong and dependable...and is about to go on his first overseas adventure! I will admit there were times in the past when I was quite ready to throw him off the top of a cliff but these days we are quite good mates!

<p>Hot soup on a cold day.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoacUub-MI/AAAAAAAAD-s/gsFHsZFwCYs/s400/IMG_3830.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is one of the many vegan soups (Tuscan bean and vegetable to be exact) from the coffee shop across the road, </span></span><a href="http://www.viewauckland.co.nz/restaurants/agnes-curran-info-56668.html"><span><span>Agnes Curran</span></span></a><span><span>. They make all their soups and are now consciously thinking about the ingredients they use and let me know when they're vegan. Plus the staff there always make me laugh (I don't drink coffee but my boss does and I'm the one to go get it...they know me very well!).

<p></p></span></span><a href="http://minimaddandy.blogspot.com/2010/07/running-at-tawharanui.html"><span><span>Running at Tawharanui</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TEY89BO3v3I/AAAAAAAAD9M/9a_0WwtcMpo/s400/100710_130007.jpg" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Waikauri Bay is my favourite place and over the hill is </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/tawharanui/"><span><span>Tawharanui Regional Park</span></span></a><span><span> which I've been exploring all my life. Running over there never gets old. Even better is sharing the experience with a friend and we even had beautiful weather...in the middle of winter!

<p>Chocolate (I mean, how could it not be part of an awesome life)!!!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj564VMSI/AAAAAAAAEBo/WKA-ihp30Bk/s400/IMG_3975.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
That (above) is a Decadent Date from </span></span><a href="http://www.shechocolat.com/"><span><span>She Chocolat</span></span></a><span><span> in Christchurch (D bought me a whole bag as a present). It's described as a fresh organic medjool date hand stuffed with a gianduja filling and coated in the finest Belgian chocolate. Delicious!

<p>New running shoes (I don't know how fond I am of the bright pink colour of my new </p></span></span><a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/p/Womens/11/Mizuno_Ladies_Wave_Nirvana_6_Shoes/5360049181/"><span><span>Mizunos</span></span></a><span><span> though but I love <a href="http://www.wiggle.co.uk/">Wiggle</a>!). Even better is getting new off road shoes and wearing them in (because I can't handle them being clean for long)! Below are my new </span></span><a href="http://www.inov-8.com/"><span><span>Inov-8</span></span></a><span><span> Roclite 285s 'cause my old ones are starting the slow trip to falling apart.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THw04kLATHI/AAAAAAAAEOM/ZzQwtu4lDMs/s400/IMG_4140.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The only thing that makes that experience even cooler is testing them out in the </span></span><a href="http://www.arc.govt.nz/parks/our-parks/parks-in-the-region/waitakere-ranges/"><span><span>Waitakere Ranges</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/THw06ASEEEI/AAAAAAAAEOQ/zPDfEhhYPHA/s400/IMG_4141.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It is like paradise (but the weather is very temperamental out there so I'm always weary of taking my camera out with me...maybe next time).

<p>Eating lunch with A at </p></span></span><a href="http://www.kokako.co.nz/"><span><span>Kokako</span></span></a><span><span> and catching up on all the gossip and drama of his life...makes for a truly entertaining experience! It's just along from my gym so A is a bit of a celebrity whenever we go too!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TDKkm3GE8FI/AAAAAAAAD4s/8OTxJjg5Foo/s400/IMG_3719.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Plus the food there is good. Above we have the tofu scramble with their awesome veggie booster juice and below is the beans on toast (which isn't really beans on toast at all since they put the beans </span></span><em><span><span>next</span></span></em><span><span> to the toast but I can forgive them!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TGPBlsLIbnI/AAAAAAAAEEE/5NAG8FCtyOU/s400/IMG_3981.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
As I was writing this I realised it could actually go on and on which is incredibly heartening!

<p>But one of the best things? Awesome friends coming to visit...I'm counting down the hours till I head out to the airport tonight!</p></span></span>

...which can also be known as Monday in Christchurch.</span></span></p>

<p>Leaving Christchurch is always hard. When I come home I find that I end up feeling quite lonely and sad.</p>

<p>But before I had to leave I met up with my friend M and we went for a little run in the mud and the drizzle around <a href="http://www.ccc.govt.nz/cityleisure/parkswalkways/popularparks/halswellquarrypark.aspx"><span><span>Halswell Quarry</span></span></a><span><span> with the aid of an orienteering map (and perhaps we may have ventured on to some private land but what no one saw, no one knows about right?).</span></span></p>

<p>Running, of course, makes you feel a bit hungry so we ventured into town for a spot of lunch at my favourite cafe, <a href="http://www.happycow.net/reviews.php?id=7315"><span><span>Soul Food</span></span></a><span><span>. M is quite indecisive and I want everything so we decided to get the vegan BLT (which is extremely yummy...probably the vegan aioli that really does it for me)...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokDuZHoII/AAAAAAAAECA/v41hJstfkX0/s400/IMG_3959.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and the vegan lentil and brown rice burger (which is very filling and healthy-tasting although not in a bad way in case you were of the opinion that healthy-tasting and delicious couldn't go hand in hand)...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokCDxLNXI/AAAAAAAAEB8/7QiHw8wuC6o/s400/IMG_3961.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...and split them. It was a good decision.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFokAVKIpeI/AAAAAAAAEB4/iMzf83q9Edg/s400/IMG_3963.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They also have 2 sweet vegan options. The first one is the fruit muffin which is really soft and delicious and the creamy stuff on the top is very nice.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj-oh1rkI/AAAAAAAAEB0/I62m_V9QG7A/s400/IMG_3964.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The second is the ginger crunch which I had on Thursday night as well at </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?client=safari&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=govinda%27s+christchurch&amp;fb=1&amp;hq=govinda%27s&amp;hnear=christchurch&amp;cid=2322395347369035221"><span><span>Govinda's</span></span></a><span><span>. Soul Food and Govinda's are actually run by the same people which is fortunate because that means you have 2 separate places you can get this most awesome ginger crunch. But as I said on a previous post, I am doing my best to replicate it!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj8tLZbfI/AAAAAAAAEBw/rpyqtj5Pz7A/s400/IMG_3966.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Again, so that neither of us got jealous, we split both choices but the ginger crunch bet the muffin hands down. There really was no contest.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoj7VLmrsI/AAAAAAAAEBs/55AElwfU8bY/s400/IMG_3968.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And then it was time to go home which was very sad. But it's okay because I will be back down that way very soon (and thank god for skype, email and all that jazz)!</span></span>

Oh man, SO busy!!! At least I'm slightly more awake than yesterday where I walked around in a bit of a dream after 3 hours of sleep. A concert (</span></span><a href="http://www.bandofhorses.com/us/home"><span><span>Band of Horses</span></span></a><span><span>...it was </span></span><a href="http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment-reviews/news/article.cfm?c_id=1502967&amp;objectid=10663559"><span><span>awesome</span></span></a><span><span>) followed by some girly time followed by cats keeping me up followed by a tiny slab of sleep snuck in somewhere followed by my 5am alarm for training is guaranteed to fry your brain especially after you've already had a string of late nights/early mornings before this. My alarm went off at a similar time this morning but I decided training could wait. I have epic plans for the next 3 days so some sleep was probably a good idea (although I still feel a tad scatterbrained).</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobefzqi_I/AAAAAAAAEA0/586H6FKSA1E/s400/IMG_3858.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, I got back from a whirlwind trip to Christchurch on Monday night, repacked my bags and headed over to my cousin's flat to look after her cats for the week. The best thing about Christchurch (apart from hanging out with my best friend) is the food. I dream about this food! In fact, I planned my flight down on Thursday afternoon especially so I could make it there in time for dinner. It meant I had to leave work early but hey, some things are more important!!

<p>Dinner at </p></span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?client=safari&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=govinda%27s+christchurch&amp;fb=1&amp;hq=govinda%27s&amp;hnear=christchurch&amp;cid=2322395347369035221"><span><span>Govinda's Vegetarian Restaurant</span></span></a><span><span>. I think this meal was, like, $5 which is dirt cheap and gets you a decent amount of curry, savory pastries and rice.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFobAX9WvwI/AAAAAAAAD_Y/0OOJN_mPEqk/s400/IMG_3835.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dessert was the best damn ginger slice ever...I have been trying to replicate it with no success so far (not that my versions haven't been delicious but just not quite up to this standard...I'm working on it!).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/TFoa-4gWV7I/AAAAAAAAD_U/1ntgzDPeo0c/s400/IMG_3839.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
There is much more food and adventuring to come (hey, I was there Thursday to Monday and there is a lot of eating you can do in that time). Oh, and some exciting news (well, if you're me anyway). Stay tuned.</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
Hello!!</span></span></p>

<p>In the past week I got to hang out in 3 of my favourite places ever as well as having some cool adventures. I had last week off work so on the Monday I cruised up to my mate's farm at Slater Road (one of my favourite places) to help out on the farm, rake some mountain bike tracks in their huge private park and get some biking and kayaking coaching. Paddling up through the mangroves was so awesome especially when we had to bash our way through in parts!</p>

<p>Of course, I can't go up there without going running with Jess so we had our own little adventure on the Tuesday afternoon. It was supposed to be a short run but time seems to melt away in the forest.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HJJ-DCnzI/AAAAAAAADi0/9ARUNZydLOs/s400/IMG_3438.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Here's Jess inside afterwards...the ultimate training companion and boy can she go fast when she wants to!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7HJMnNPcPI/AAAAAAAADjA/uh7s7TgE6gY/s400/IMG_3441.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
To prove I am capable of relaxing, the following morning The Chef and I headed off to my beach house at </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Waikauri+Bay,+New+Zealand&amp;sll=-36.618697,174.342384&amp;sspn=0.089832,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;cd=1&amp;geocode=Febk1P0dEGZrCg&amp;split=0&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Waikauri+Bay&amp;z=13"><span><span>Waikauri Bay</span></span></a><span><span> which is quite possibly my favourite place in the whole world. I have many awesome memories of endless summers playing in the waves and exploring the hills. Pretty much all we did was eat, read, wander along the beach and round the rocks and laze about.

<p>Anyway, on the drive up we stopped off at the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.matakanavillage.co.nz/stores/black_dog_cafe.php"><span><span>Black Dog Cafe</span></span></a><span><span> in Matakana for lunch. I got this warmed roast vegetable salad which was really nice but not exactly filling.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9sdVBwPI/AAAAAAAADjs/HFrPFBURm0Q/s400/IMG_3444.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Dinner more than made up for a light lunch (although we did demolish a packet of pita crisps) with tofu sausages topped with fried onion and mushrooms alongside steamed broccoli and kumara chips. I think I ate my weight in kumara chips that night!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9tl6kTdI/AAAAAAAADjw/kTd6L5bq42E/s400/IMG_3446.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The following morning we ate the leftover kumara chips covered in maple syrup. I had no idea this would be such a good combination but I am definitely going to have it again soon!

<p>I had leftover waffle mixture in my freezer from the dessert party so brought that up with us for breakfast the next day. While I was in charge of the waffles, The Chef cooked up some caramelised apple and feijoas in maple syrup.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9vGBlB2I/AAAAAAAADj0/ab444KnN-gM/s400/IMG_3447.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Throughout the course of the day we managed to polish off over a kilogram of feijoas. Well, the bag had to be finished so it was up to us to eat them all! I love feijoa season!

<p>Lunch of champions...falafel, fresh bread with hummus and a mega salad.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p9wK8EjkI/AAAAAAAADj4/HvtjnRWoUXA/s400/IMG_3450.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The Chef thought he'd eat his portion as a sandwich. Um, yeah...watching him try to wrap his mouth around this mammoth monster was hilarious!

<p>But I can never relax for too long and Thursday night I was off to the airport and flying down South to Otago for the National Orienteering Champs. This is my first year running in the elite grade for all races so I was pretty excited...but pretty nervous.</p>

<p>The first race was the sprint event in </p></span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=roxburgh,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-36.866443,174.772559&amp;sspn=0.044771,0.066347&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Roxburgh,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=13"><span><span>Roxburgh</span></span></a><span><span>. Ah, not my finest moment after a bad route choice ending up in thick scrub down a valley. But I did pull out some good splits for the last few controls which was good since you were visible to all the spectators on the hill for that final section!</span></span><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p92FvePPI/AAAAAAAADkA/YlfF86zPP8U/s400/IMG_3453.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The second day was the middle distance event in </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Bannockburn,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.539919,169.313904&amp;sspn=0.078392,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Bannockburn,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=12"><span><span>Bannockburn</span></span></a><span><span> which was just out of Cromwell. Heaps of cliffs, some killer climbs and more scrub for me to get caught in!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p93EgmJ0I/AAAAAAAADkE/VNan3deU9-0/s400/IMG_3456.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The long distance event was just out of Alexandra at </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Earnscleugh,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.089691,169.161136&amp;sspn=0.158035,0.265388&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Earnscleugh,+Otago,+New+Zealand&amp;z=13"><span><span>Earnscleugh Station</span></span></a><span><span> and it was bitterly cold, very exposed, quite steep, very rocky, extremely fast terrain and (for us running the elite women's grade) a very long course. Oh, and a nasty barbed wire, outrigger fence. Below is the final stretch to the finish and boy was I glad to make it that far!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p94Ybg9cI/AAAAAAAADkI/IpCQCtFRhXw/s400/IMG_3461.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'm not normally a fan of the relay event 'cause it always feels like so much pressure...if you stuff up or manage to mispunch or something then you let your whole team down but I was so looking forward to this one 'cause it was being held in </span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Naseby,+new+zealand&amp;sll=-45.21606,169.310859&amp;sspn=0.078843,0.132694&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Naseby,+New+Zealand&amp;z=11"><span><span>Naesby</span></span></a><span><span> which is another very special place to me. Oh, and I was in an awesome relay team with a couple of great mates out to have fun. We decided not to take it too seriously and wore our race numbers sideways just to be a bit different.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S7p95XrL0tI/AAAAAAAADkM/MFtOzCaah8Q/s400/IMG_3471.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Here's the start of the relay which is always chaos. Lucky I was second-leg runner.</span></span><div><span style="font-family:verdana, serif;"><span> <br>
</span></span></div><div><span style="font-family:verdana, serif;"><span>So after all that adventuring I was actually quite glad to arrive home to Auckland and it gave me its usual greeting by pouring down with rain! It's good to be home.</span></span></div></div>

Right, well I'm nearly caught up at last (I've finally made it back to 2010 again)! As I mentioned </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2010/01/i-made-it.html"><span><span>before</span></span></a><span><span>, I spent a few days up north house-sitting (and animal sitting for their dog and 3 cats) at my mate's farm and making the most of their property to put in some training.</span></span></p>

<p>This is Jess.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o5qBrhDxI/AAAAAAAADOs/Uw1SjLjLUZY/s400/IMG_3205.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
She would join me on all my training sessions which was super cool 'cause when you're out in the middle of some thick bush with no cellphone coverage for several hours it's nice to have a bit of company. She's gorgeous but every time I tried to take a photo of her it came out terribly so you'll just have to take my word for how beautiful she is!

<p>Anyway, I ate pretty well when I was up there. I'm still on a huge salad obsession which is just perfect for this hot summer weather we've been having.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o5yqTqx7I/AAAAAAAADO8/9ihPJpQ6Al0/s400/IMG_3178.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Heaps of veges, half a can of mixed beans, hummus, balsamic salad dressing and crusty bread. Awesome. Unfortunately I couldn't find their grater so had to have carrot peels instead which takes awhile to do.

<p>You really can't go past a good salad sandwich especially with good bread.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o5zV9tNpI/AAAAAAAADPA/bYRtEL2-w5Y/s400/IMG_3181.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was some random Turkish garlic bread that you bake in the oven for a few minutes first. So good!

<p>Stir-fried veggies and tofu is another of my big favourite meals of the moment.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o50UDoaVI/AAAAAAAADPE/qSM6PpHB3WQ/s400/IMG_3186.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
With the increase in my training I've been trying to eat more carbs with dinner 'cause I'd been getting a bit lazy about it so I baked some kumara chunks to go with it.

<p>Yep, another tofu stir-fry!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o51dRaY9I/AAAAAAAADPI/plvTIB5hkAE/s400/IMG_3198.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Add a bit of peanut butter to my usual marinade (sweet chilli, tamari, sometimes a bit of hoisin sauce, garlic) and I'm in heaven!

<p>And another giant sandwich!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o52Ak_e_I/AAAAAAAADPM/gDfVD9KvVrs/s400/IMG_3202.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This one had pan-fried tofu slices along with all the salad stuff and I actually ate this for breakfast before an epic ride.

<p>I was also testing how my stomach coped with various flavours of clif bars during training in preparation for some long adventure races and rogaines in the future. It's important to test out this kind of thing </p></span></span><em><span><span>before</span></span></em><span><span> the race rather than on the day!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/S0o53hqdAEI/AAAAAAAADPQ/Cl9495DEzw8/s400/IMG_3192.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I've used the Cool Mint Chocolate flavour before and that works well but the only other one there that was okay was the White Chocolate Macadamia one. The peanut butter ones felt too sticky which is fine to just enjoy but it didn't sit well in my stomach once I got moving again and were also harder to eat 'cause I had to chew more. Yeah, sounds a bit weird I know! The Chocolate Brownie PureFit bar is great though.</span></span>

So much to talk about! This year is certainly starting off on a pretty exciting note! Anyway, where to start?! Right, I think we will travel back in time to 2009 for today before it all becomes a distant memory.</span></span></p>

<p>After our family Christmas party (but before Christmas itself) I went up to our beach house to get a bit of timeout and do some training. Here's a few photos of the sights experienced during some of my training sessions...</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6MTiZEVfI/AAAAAAAADMo/vgQyzGFBY2w/s400/IMG_3091.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>The flowers on the Pohutukawa tree that come out in the summer...it is sometimes called the New Zealand Christmas tree.</span></span></em></center><em><span><span> <br>

Right out at the furthest point on the peninsula looking down to the coastline below. It's even more amazing when the tide's in and the weather is wild.</span></span></center><span><span> <br>
</span></span></em><center><em><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6MX9Qit1I/AAAAAAAADMs/BGQrub8nHfI/s400/IMG_3102.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>

Food was eaten of course. I had got some leftovers from the Christmas Party with me so that was the first night's dinner...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6Ln2heRnI/AAAAAAAADLg/8mLI3ZpRreE/s400/IMG_3079.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The next night I had some kind of curried lentil pie I'd got at the health food shop along with more kumara salad leftovers (which reminds me, I still haven't gotten the recipe off Mum to share with you guys).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6LskwL3YI/AAAAAAAADLo/50LdXKmTTBo/s400/IMG_3081.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
And finally, tofu stir-fry with some kind of fresh turkish bread...delicious!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6LpuojbKI/AAAAAAAADLk/GkwQkzWmXTQ/s400/IMG_3103.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Christmas Day itself I didn't do so well of documenting! My flatmates thought it was quite funny I had stir-fry for breakfast but my body has been asking for strange things lately with the increase of training so I just tend to listen to what it wants. Then lunch at the parents was just salad sandwiches so nothing too exciting. But the evening...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6LxgBIFHI/AAAAAAAADLw/yIbyshYaQwM/s400/IMG_3117.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My lovely cousin and I decided to ditch dinner entirely and go straight for dessert! Above is blueberry cobbler veganised and adapted from a blackberry cobbler recipe my American sister sent me. SO good!

<p>We also had trifle...because it is D's favourite. We had the chocolate variant at the Christmas party so this time I made a basic one with a plain sponge and vanilla custard. D also brought round berry-flavoured lite licks ice cream which was divine.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6LuO-UZ8I/AAAAAAAADLs/0yhsPTJk3I4/s400/IMG_3114.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My bowl...there may have been more consumed than this...!

<p>Hmmmm...this post has got quite long already so you'll have to wait till next time to find out about after-Christmas adventures and food!</p></span></span>
