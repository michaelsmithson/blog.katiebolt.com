I am SO tired! Yesterday we had a fun 3 hour night </span></span><a href="http://www.rogaining.com/"><span><span>rogaine</span></span></a><span><span> event round some of the local streets and I didn't get back from that until pretty late and then I got up for spin this morning. I'm very much in need of a nap right about now.</span></span></p>

<p>Here's my epic breakfast...a super thick banana smoothie (frozen banana, frozen berries, ground flaxseed, tahini, cocoa and oat milk) topped with muesli and chopped almonds and walnuts. SO good.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrxFvI0QmRI/AAAAAAAAC3o/oevg8swImLU/s400/IMG_2743.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, after my superpowered breakfast I had to race into town to meet Mum to go check out the </span></span><a href="http://www.ritaangus.com/"><span><span>Rita Angus</span></span></a><span><span> (a well-known New Zealand artist) exhibition at the </span></span><a href="http://www.aucklandartgallery.govt.nz/"><span><span>Auckland City Art Gallery</span></span></a><span><span>. After wandering round the display for about 2 hours (and debating which were our favourites and where we would hang them if we owned them!) we were famished and in need of lunch.

<p>Revel delivered with both of us ordering the Vegan Reveller.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrxFwF66OWI/AAAAAAAAC3s/UaDcNzqDG7c/s400/IMG_2747.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
How can you possibly go wrong with a huge plate of giant falafels with grilled tomatoes, mushrooms, spinach, hummus, sundried tomato and basil pestos all served with lightly toasted bread?

<p>Despite being so full after all this food that we could hardly move, dessert had to be ordered so we grabbed a couple of slices of the Peanut Butter Cake/Pie/whatever to take away and managed to wander down to Albert Park to indulge.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrxFw9IAtqI/AAAAAAAAC3w/wxIic3OvQqs/s400/IMG_2750.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is what all Fridays should be made of (in case you were wondering, that's two slices of cake/pie and no, unfortunately I didn't get to eat them both as I had to share with Mum!).</span></span>

<span><span> <br>
Breakfast is my favourite meal of the day hands down. I can have it at any time of the day, doesn't really matter as long as it's breakfast food!</span></span></p>

<p>When I'm at home for breakfast (which seems to be only about 2 or 3 times a week at the moment) I normally have cereal and fruit. It's regular comfort food (I've been known to have the odd day where I've had this for lunch and/or dinner as well!).</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sp3XCCjp-3I/AAAAAAAACwI/z0nbJmJsHIA/s400/IMG_2609.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
My regular at the moment is a couple of weetbix, a handful of muesli (what ever I've got in the pantry at the time), a golden kiwifruit and a spoonful of peanut butter doused in heaps of rice milk. This will keep me going until lunchtime no problem.

<p>Sometimes on a Saturday morning I might have a smoothie before yoga if I haven't been out running beforehand (I'm normally way behind schedule if I've gone running so it's cereal or a muesli bar as I'm racing out the door).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdmdZlnCI/AAAAAAAACxQ/JVq0Wl9OYRI/s400/IMG_2631.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Sometimes it's a green smoothie, sometimes it's just your regular as above (frozen banana, frozen mixed berries, peanut butter, ground flaxseed, rice milk). I like it thick enough to eat with a spoon!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SrfnqZ4pAeI/AAAAAAAAC2s/u1nUQIce4BQ/s400/IMG_2733.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This morning I didn't feel like my usual weetbix so I made a super thick smoothie so it was a bit more like ice cream and I ate it out of a bowl topped with muesli and chopped almonds and walnuts. SO delicious!

<p>If I'm having breakfast at work (the mornings I'm training before work) I'll have a homemade texas muffin and fruit (my favourites are the </p></span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/07/waking-up-and-eating.html"><span><span>Blueberry Ginger Spelt Muffins</span></span></a><span><span> and the </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/09/turning-up-heat.html"><span><span>Zucchini Spelt Muffins</span></span></a><span><span> both from </span></span><a href="http://www.theppk.com/vegan-brunch.html"><span><span>Vegan Brunch</span></span></a><span><span>) or toast (homemade bread...I love my breadmaker!) with almond butter and jam.

<p>There are times though when I'll put on my apron (metaphorically speaking since my apron normally hangs forlornly in my bedroom and my clothes bear the brunt of my messiness) and make something more exciting. Unfortunately I've had a fair amount on lately so haven't had time in the morning to make something exciting like waffles or pancakes...hopefully this weekend? Can't wait to make those </p></span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/08/bullet-proof-food-and-toasted-memories.html"><span><span>Peanut Butter Waffles</span></span></a><span><span> or some </span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/09/in-search-of-perfection.html"><span><span>girdle scones</span></span></a><span><span> again though...

<p>Sometimes though I might even go out for breakfast/brunch/a meal before midday. </p></span></span><a href="http://www.kokako.co.nz/"><span><span>Kokako</span></span></a><span><span> is just up the road from my gym so sometimes I might head there on a Saturday or Sunday morning for some fueling up.

This is their tofu scramble and it is really good...tofu chunks, tomato, mushrooms, potato and super grainy bread. Guaranteed to make your morning.</span></span>

There is no problem involved in becoming your own father or mother that a broadminded and well adjusted family can't cope with. There is also no problem about changing the course of history - the course of history does not change because it all fits together like a jigsaw. All the important changes have happened before the things they were supposed to change and it all sorts itself out in the end. <br>

A few things that help to brighten up bad days...</span></span></p>

<p>Scoring free bittersweet <a href="http://www.whittakers.co.nz/"><span><span>Whittakers</span></span></a><span><span> chocolate from the boys at the coffee shop across the road from work. They definitely know how to brighten a bad day.</span></span></p>

Running especially as it becomes lighter in the mornings and I can run round the local parks instead of having to stick to the streets. It's even better when I have new running shoes (and having them contain some of my favourite colours). This morning it was light enough not long after 6am to run through the bush tracks in the </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auckland_Domain"><span><span>Auckland Domain</span></span></a><span><span>. Yay!

Finding Vanilla Tofutti Cuties at the </span></span><a href="http://www.choosecrueltyfree.org.nz/"><span><span>Safe</span></span></a><span><span> store on K'Rd. This is the kind of thing I never thought we'd get here. I seriously could not believe how awesome these tasted. Hopefully we will get a few more flavours.

Being out in the forest even on drizzly, wet days. Clears your head and frees your mind. My favourite thing to do out at the forest is orienteering...can't wait for the events this weekend.

<span><span> <br>
I'd never had a protein bar before but I saw these at the health food store and thought I'd try some since none of the usual ones I get in race packs and that I've seen people have are vegan.</span></span></p><div><span><span> <br>
</span></span><strong><span><span><center>Peanut Butter Crunch</center></span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SoyndFzsD5I/AAAAAAAAClc/cCKbm87akLg/s400/IMG_2541.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I don't know what I expected it to be like but it tasted very strongly of peanut butter...kind of like eating it straight out of the jar mixed with sugar. It also felt like it was sticking to the roof of my mouth which wasn't that pleasant (yes, I was drinking plenty of water too). I think I'd rather just eat the peanut butter (natural peanut butter though 'cause this tastes a bit more processed). I will admit that it took the shakiness out of my legs after the race but hey, I suspect anything would have considering I hadn't eaten for about 4 hours and I'd just run solid for 3. Perhaps I should have had some out there on the course to see what it was like but my stomach is not big on eating whilst racing.

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span><center>Chocolate Brownie</center></span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sp7c1udZImI/AAAAAAAACwk/N9ENIo_9Nbw/s400/IMG_2612.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This flavour was much better for me. This time I tried it before heading out for a run after work. It wasn't too sweet and had a bit of crunch to it and more than held me over till I got around to making dinner (actually, I wasn't hungry at all when I got back which was good as I didn't end up eating until about 8:30pm). I wonder if it feels left out being the only one without </span></span><em><span><span>Crunch</span></span></em><span><span> in its name...?!

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span><center>Berry Almond Crunch</center></span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqjGZtjq96I/AAAAAAAAC0I/YcOPhRhNS8w/s400/IMG_2678.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Again I had this bar before heading out for a run after work that evening. I didn't have high expectations of it but it turned out to be pretty good...at least for the first half until it got a bit sweet. The berry taste wasn't too sickly and the almonds gave it a nice crunch and subtle nutty taste. It definitely held me over until dinner which was pretty late and it didn't sit in my stomach the way some bars do while I run but I still preferred the Chocolate Brownie flavour.

<p></p></span></span><strong><span><span><center>Almond Crunch</center></span></span></strong><span><span> <br>
</span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRd4biwphI/AAAAAAAACxo/yAwpAg3v6CQ/s400/IMG_2638.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Maybe it was because I didn't drink enough water but I found this bar a little hard to stomach. It was quite sticky like the peanut butter flavour and had a fairly strong taste of almond essence. Now I love almonds and I adore almond butter but I'm not a fan of almond essence so I was kind of disappointed. I tried this bar midway through biking out at the </span></span><a href="http://www.bikepark.co.nz/"><span><span>Woodhill Bike Park</span></span></a><span><span> and it held me over till I got home again but I was starving not long after walking in the door.

It's probably just me but I thought you might be interested in what a "normal" weekday looks like for me. Every day is quite different but you get the general idea...</span></span></p>

<p>So the alarm on my phone goes off at 5:10am...welcome to Monday morning. I drag on my gym gear...laid out on the chair the night before so I don't have to use my brain. I try and drink as much water as I can manage and eat one of <a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2009/09/fueling-up.html"><span><span>these</span></span></a><span><span>...</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdpOFnnwI/AAAAAAAACxY/K7QEO6xYgq4/s400/IMG_2640.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Off to the </span></span><a href="http://www.olympicpools.co.nz/"><span><span>gym</span></span></a><span><span>! There is a queue of us completely insane people waiting outside for opening time at 5:45am. We file in, dump our gear in the lockers and head upstairs and across the bridge over the pool into the gym where I head to the peleton room and claim a bike (this is why I'm here so early...bikes go pretty fast especially as the weather improves...don't know why that is!). Spin class starts at 6:05am and is a 45 minute torture session taken by my friend L. After class I head over to the floor to finish up with some core exercises and stretches.

<p>Time to hit the showers. I only wash my hair once a week (okay, so I rinse it if it gets too icky from sport but that's it) and Monday is the day...the gym showers are great and I don't feel quite so bad about taking too long. Because I have a really sensitive scalp I use </p></span></span><a href="http://www.purist.com/product.php?product=24"><span><span>this shampoo</span></span></a><span><span> and </span></span><a href="http://www.purist.com/product.php?product=36"><span><span>this conditioner</span></span></a><span><span>. These don't make my hair as soft and silky as other products I've tried but they don't make my scalp feel like it's erupting which is rather more important!

<p>It's then off to work where I'll have breakfast at my desk. Yesterday it was a spelt muffin and fruit but sometimes I'll have toast with almond butter and jam. If I'm at home for breakfast it's normally weetbix, fruit and rice milk.</p>

</span></span><em><span><span>Did I really just take a photo of fruit? Not very exciting...well, as a photo anyway!</span></span></em></center><span><span>

Work comes and goes but no doubt I'll spend a bit too much time having email conversations with a couple of my friends as I count down till lunchtime!

<p>Lunchtime has been leftovers lately which is awesome. When I'm cooking dinner I'll often try to make extra 'cause I don't want to have to buy lunch (for a start there aren't that many options near my office).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqRdsHgDQOI/AAAAAAAACxk/Df7_OZAY0oU/s400/IMG_2646.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yesterday was leftover Pumpkin and Kumara Soup from the freezer mixed with leftover veges and tofu from another night - a double-whammy of leftovers!

<p>Often Monday nights are quiet but last night I was climbing with my brother and his friend at </p></span></span><a href="http://extremeedge.co.nz/"><span><span>Extreme Edge</span></span></a><span><span>. We usually climb together about once a week but the night is always different to fit in with everyone's schedules. We are looking at doing a lead climbing course soon which is pretty much freaking me out.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVxIYItdaI/AAAAAAAACys/abyDqSqMEN0/s400/IMG_2658.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVxGwhHCsI/AAAAAAAACyo/YLi42bd8iUs/s400/IMG_2663.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>My brother really wanted his arse to feature on this blog so here it is, just for you darling bro!</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
Anyway, before climbing I will normally snack on a muesli bar of some sort. Last night it was a Cool Mint Chocolate </span></span><a href="http://www.clifbar.com/"><span><span>Clif Bar</span></span></a><span><span>, my favourite.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVui6dTmsI/AAAAAAAACyc/XlWXWudPhSY/s400/IMG_2647.JPG" alt="" title=""> <br>
</span></span><em><span><span>I just noticed that there is a picture of a climber on the clif bar packet...how appropriate!</span></span></em></center><span><span> <br>
By the time I get home I'll no doubt be exhausted as I always fail in my resolution to go to bed early on a Sunday night so very little sleep will have been had! I'll also undoubtably be hungry (if we haven't gone to get </span></span><a href="https://hellpizza.co.nz/"><span><span>Hell Pizza</span></span></a><span><span> after climbing). Last night I was too lazy to do anything so I had nut butter and jam on toast! Terrible I know but it was after 9pm when I got home and sometimes you just can't be bothered.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVuk3mETPI/AAAAAAAACyk/HGIMyiw_Qls/s400/IMG_2671.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This is actually a photo of a previous breakfast but I forgot to take a photo of my dinner...but they looked exactly the same! I also discovered I had a bliss ball in the fridge from </span></span><a href="http://www.thebluebird.co.nz/"><span><span>The Blue Bird</span></span></a><span><span> so I snacked on that too. Yummy!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqVuj2u00YI/AAAAAAAACyg/gB9ikWGfTxo/s400/IMG_2669.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I'll then pack my bags and organise my gear and in the fridge I'll put all my breakfast and lunch food for the next day in a bag ready for me to grab as I race out the door. Then I can finally drop into bed (always aiming for 10pm but not always succeeding!) and look forward to doing it all again in the morning!

<p>Hmmmm, this seems to make my life seem somewhat boring but actually it's pretty cool (well, I think so anyway) and hopelessly busy (</p></span></span><a href="https://www.google.com/calendar"><span><span>Google Calendar</span></span></a><span><span> saves my life). I often wonder how I'm going to make it to the end of the week without dropping from exhaustion but I always do and am always ready and waiting for the week to start again come Sunday night!</span></span>

</div>Most mornings I am up super early for training...either running, spin class or a gym session (today, because I'm slightly crazy at times, I went to spin and then went for a training run with a friend...lucky I don't work today so I can go back to bed and have a nana nap!). Although I could never eat a proper breakfast before heading out, I certainly can't train on an empty stomach so I normally have some fruit or a muesli bar. These bars are SO good and keep me going right up until I hit the showers (and then I'm definitely ready for breakfast!).</span></span></p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SmJbICak8JI/AAAAAAAACbQ/YHyvWly9r4Q/s400/IMG_2446.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I've changed the recipe enough that it's probably okay to post it so here it is (although each time I make a batch I end up changing the ingredients a bit anyway...it's pretty forgiving):

<p>¼ cup agave nectar<br>
¼ cup molasses<br>
¼ cup rice syrup<br>
¼ cup almond butter<br>
¼ cup peanut butter<br>
⅔ cup chopped dried fruit<br>
1 tsp vanilla essence <br>
1 cup rolled oats <br>
1 cup wholegrain oats <br>
1 cup rye oats <br>
¼ cup ground flaxseed<br>
¼ cup pumpkin seeds<br>
¼ cup sesame seeds<br>
¼ cup sunflower seeds<br>
¾ cup coconut thread</p>

<p>Heat the agave nectar, molasses, rice syrup, almond butter, peanut butter and dried fruit together in a medium saucepan until the mixture starts to simmer, stirring to make sure the mixture doesn’t stick to the bottom of the pan.</p>

<p>Once it starts to bubble take the pan off the heat.</p>

<p>Mix in the rest of the ingredients (you might need to use your hands here to get it to mix in properly).</p>

<p>Line the base and sides of a 20cm x 20cm baking dish with baking paper and press the mixture firmly into the pan (the firmer you press it in, the better the bars will hold together).</p>

<p>Freezer the mixture in the pan for about 20 minutes and then remove and tip the set mixture onto a cutting board. Slice into bars (I find a bread knife best here). This recipe makes somewhere between 15 and 20 depending on the size you want them but don’t make them too big ‘cause they’re pretty dense!</p>

<p>Wrap each bar up individually and store either in the fridge or freezer.</p></span></span>
