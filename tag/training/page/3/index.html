They hit each other's bottoms, pinch each other's breasts, and dance for each other, arms flailing like snakes, hips like Arab belly dancers. Little girls dance as though they were born to seduce and wriggle across the floor with challenging looks and raised eyebrows. Even the old grannies test the water, but give up halfway, before the dance is over. The old magic is still there but they haven't got the stamina to see the dance out. <br>

Happy New Year!!! I hope everyone had an awesome time and that the year ahead is full of promise. Mine was spent having the time of my life down in Gisborne at the </span></span><a href="http://www.rhythmandvines.co.nz/"><span><span>Rhythm &amp; Vines</span></span></a><span><span> music festival. Seriously, best new years ever with some of the most awesome people in the whole world. It's been a pretty rough year but I've made it through and found my feet. This year is going to be my year!</span></span></p>

<p>I've got a heap of photos and stories from Christmas and all that (although I forgot to take my camera to Gisborne so will have to grab the photos off my flatmates) but that will wait. Right now I'm up north house-sitting at my mates' farm. It's like a little slice of paradise.</p>

I arrived late this morning and after lunch (how can you not love that view?)...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7zd0_-f1I/AAAAAAAADOI/82TY0QNKxAU/s400/IMG_3148.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
...I went for a cruise round their own personal mountain bike park! Yep, the property is pretty big and has an expansive, steep patch of (mostly) pine forest filled with mountain bike tracks. It's even been mapped (we use their property a bit for mountain bike orienteering).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz6MayxLn1I/AAAAAAAADM0/G0I9s_DvArY/s400/IMG_3131.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

After the ride it was time for a dip in the pool and a bit of a nap. Their cats seemed to think that was a good idea too...here's one of them lazing around in the study!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7znsxUBjI/AAAAAAAADOU/b29zNKG1gIk/s400/IMG_3146.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Then in the evening it was time to whip up some dinner. Feeling a bit tired (I think I'm still in recovery from the rather epic new years and an equally epic drive back yesterday afternoon) I didn't really have the energy for anything too exciting.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/Sz7zfS4-i3I/AAAAAAAADOM/IZgPatEgj2E/s400/IMG_3171.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>

<span><span> <br>
Training can get a little (okay, make that a lot) exhausting and boring at times so sometimes it's good to mix things up a little and do something a little different...</span></span></p>

<p>How about a spin class on the top of a tall hotel/apartment complex in town overlooking the harbour? Oh, and how about adding some rain, wind and sun too?! Yes, it's possible! Last Saturday was <a href="http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/CU0910/S00311.htm">Skyspin</a>, a 12-hour event of various different spin classes throughout the day on the top of the Waldorf Apartment Hotel. A friend of mine was taking one of the <a href="http://www.tonybanksphotography.com/Adobe%20Web%20Gallery/content/SkySpinTBP171009_159_large.html">afternoon classes</a> so a group of us from my gym thought we'd better show up and give some support (oh, and it was for a good cause...<a href="http://www.mercyhospice.org.nz/">hospice</a>). SO much fun (although rather wet and windy!).</p>

<p>Anyway, let me introduce you to my favourite dish of all time, even managing to scrap ahead of Food Alley's claypot. I can't believe I only discovered it a couple of months ago when my flatmate was having it.</p>

<p>So what could it possibly be?</p>

<p>(Tofu) Sausage Salad!!!</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/St4d0ktrIwI/AAAAAAAAC9A/stu4Qm-HBu0/s400/IMG_2928.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Not only is it super quick and basically just uses any kind of salad item you have in your possession but it's also ridiculously tasty. My flatmates and I eat these on a very regular basis that it's becoming a bit of a joke around here.

<p>So how do you make such an awesome meal?! Well it's pretty simple and you can basically use what ever you like but below is how I made the salad above...</p>

<p>Firstly, layer your bowl with a handful of baby spinach leaves then sprinkle some grated carrot over the top. Next, add a sliced tomato and some chopped capsicum (yellow is my favourite to eat raw). Then top with half a sliced avocado and some chopped, dried dates. Drizzle over a little balsamic salad dressing and add a couple of dollops of roasted garlic hummus. Finally, top with two sliced tofu sausages and some chopped walnuts. It just couldn't get any better!</p></span></span>

<span><span> <br>
My final day in the garden city, Monday, dawned perfectly clear and fine so our mission was apparent...to climb outside at last! But first, breakfast...</span></span></p>

<p>We'd decided we were going to go back to <a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/">The Lotus Heart</a> to try out their breakfast menu. The sun was streaming in through the window by our table overlooking Cathedral Square and while we waited for our breakfast to be served I had a chai latte made with rice milk.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYprjd9mI/AAAAAAAAC7M/om6dkiOR6cQ/s400/IMG_2823.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Believe it or not I had never had french toast, vegan or not, until this morning. Once I tried to come here for brunch to order it but we missed brunch by about 10 minutes so today I was determined!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYrByC1RI/AAAAAAAAC7Q/FD4D_2H8sOY/s400/IMG_2825.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was so delicious - grainy bread for the french toast with caramalised bananas sandwiched in the middle and served with fresh fruit salad and maple syrup. It filled me up for hours. I'm going to have to learn how to make my own french toast now!

<p>After breakfast we let our food settle before I set off for a short run to stretch the legs and B biked round the block. We debated trying somewhere new for lunch but were running short on time so settled on going back to </p></span></span><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=15666020981016691371&amp;q=soul+food,+christchurch"><span><span>Soul Food</span></span></a><span><span>. We both picked this delicious flavoured green tea drink to try...refreshing.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYtnLCZMI/AAAAAAAAC7Y/xZzZQkCUNCg/s400/IMG_2827.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I was hoping they'd have a vegan BLT left but unfortunately we were obviously a bit late and the cafe had been super busy so there was none left so I ordered the vege burger (same as B ordered on Saturday) and salad instead.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYsSZxSoI/AAAAAAAAC7U/zWxDDh18nww/s400/IMG_2830.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Delicious (but not as good as the BLT). Why can't we have food like this easily accessible in Auckland? Or am I looking in all the wrong places?

<p>Anyway, after lunch we headed off to the Port Hills (the only real hills in Christchurch!) and to a patch of rock called Rapaki where we met up with one of B's climbing friends.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdtr6oe2I/AAAAAAAAC7g/7XXEaX9TU-w/s400/IMG_2917.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Climbing outside is quite different to climbing on a wall inside. For a start you can use anything you can as handholds or to put your feet but it isn't immediately obvious what you can use. We climbed fairly easy climbs since it was my first outdoor experience but it was still tough work as it was so different (and SO hot).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPd0VorA8I/AAAAAAAAC70/RNHm0Ijgbdo/s400/IMG_2890.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Look at that view off the side of the wall...it was such an amazing experience. I am totally doing this again (I've become seriously hooked on climbing).

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdxI7XAyI/AAAAAAAAC7o/4C_-y4QpiFA/s400/IMG_2904.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
A glorious end to what was quite possibly one of the best weekends I've had in a long long time. As I hopped on the plane I was kind of wishing I didn't have to leave...although my body sure was glad to be able to resort to normal eating habits!

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdyQZL7AI/AAAAAAAAC7s/2cXfNbO3d7A/s400/IMG_2843.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center>

<span><span> <br>
Sunday morning did not quite start off as planned (this being last Sunday, not today in case anyone was confused). We had planned to go to </span></span><a href="http://theorangetree.co.nz/"><span><span>The Orange Tree</span></span></a><span><span> for brunch but it was closed. So off to the <a href="http://www.artscentre.org.nz/Weekend-market/marketsearch.asp">art centre market</a> it was for souvlaki from the Dimitri's stall instead! It might not be what I'd typically see as brunch food but you really can't go to Christchurch and not have a souvlaki.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYfFpCC0I/AAAAAAAAC6k/PZtG-bOj-Js/s400/IMG_2801.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yep, that's one HUGE falafel souvlaki because B made us both get doubles. Seriously could not finish this but it was delicious. We washed them down with fresh lemonade from the market whilst lazing in the sun. Awesome.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYgd_ioVI/AAAAAAAAC6o/rBEM5GnQFwo/s400/IMG_2802.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Once we got home we also might have snacked on some chocolate biscuits B had picked up from the supermarket...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYhrXvnsI/AAAAAAAAC6w/NfWpo2s-7f8/s400/IMG_2803.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Once brunch had settled (which took a hell of a long time!) we headed off to </span></span><a href="http://ecan.govt.nz/advice/recreation-and-parks/waimakariri-park/Pages/mcleans-island.aspx"><span><span>McLeans Island</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPd2BGDuGI/AAAAAAAAC74/gEisHgAGYeo/s400/IMG_2806.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
While B fitted in some mountain bike training I ran round the walking track and took the detour out to the river. I wish I'd had my camera out there as it was beautiful.

<p>Not much is open on a Sunday night in Christchurch but we did manage to find somewhere, the </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thedux.co.nz/index.cfm/index.cfm/christchurch/home"><span><span>Dux de Lux</span></span></a><span><span>, which used to be a vegetarian restaurant/bar but has since added seafood to their menu. They still have a good selection of vegan options though. Both B and I picked options that we could share.

<p>My meal came with salad and I picked the rice and the carrot salads. Very tasty and I had to restrain myself from eating all of it whilst waiting for the rest of my meal to be served.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYi5AEfaI/AAAAAAAAC60/esOBtUdO6tM/s400/IMG_2811.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ordered the sweetcorn and vegetable fritters which came with a beetroot chutney.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYk_bg5KI/AAAAAAAAC68/V553WhePctA/s400/IMG_2815.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
They were huge and delicious with a crunchy outside and a gooey, creamy inside and the chutney went really well. Filled the spot perfectly.

<p>B also picked the rice salad and also went with a couscous salad which we weren't fans of.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYj8c1qkI/AAAAAAAAC64/5i4HDjUk5BQ/s400/IMG_2813.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
For his main B ordered the Indian curry which was served with rice, chapatti, raita and mango chutney.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYmKF08JI/AAAAAAAAC7A/6KsBTPvZ2rk/s400/IMG_2817.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The curry was pretty delicious and hearty but the chutney was best avoided...tasted like eating a really sweet mango jam which would be fine in some contexts but not this one.

<p>Because we were starving and getting quite good at ordering (and eating) WAY too much food, we also ordered some kumara fries on the side with sweet chilli sauce. I love kumara fries and we polished them all off despite being so full we couldn't move!</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYnBxd3uI/AAAAAAAAC7E/CwyjvQCQrUU/s400/IMG_2819.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Because we hadn't had dessert (which was a requirement for the weekend challenge!) we made brownies (yes, crazy I know)!! Using an </span></span><a href="http://www.orgran.com/"><span><span>Orgran</span></span></a><span><span> Chocolate Muffin Mix, we followed the vegan version but used soy milk instead of water and added peanut butter and chopped chocolate (I think we got a bit carried away on the chocolate chopping front but hey, chocolate is all good) and then cooked it in a large square cake pan.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StTvkrJjpFI/AAAAAAAAC8A/3DYF1YJOAKk/s400/IMG_2821.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It turned out really well especially when served warm with </span></span><a href="http://www.icecream.co.nz/litelicks.cfm"><span><span>Lite Licks</span></span></a><span><span> Hokey Pokey ice cream. Just to state the obvious, I was ridiculously full after this again! Hmmm...perhaps the theme of the weekend?!</span></span></div>

- </span></span><em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span>The Other Boleyn Girl</span></span></em><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span> by Philippa Gregory</span></span>
<span><span> <br>
Saturday started with a slice of peanut butter and banana toast which I couldn't be bothered photographing since it was terribly unexciting and not part of our food challenge. Then we set off on a short run round </span></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hagley_Park"><span><span>Hagley Park</span></span></a><span><span> from his flat (we are going to be doing </span></span><a href="http://www.lacticturkey.co.nz/P6.htm"><span><span>this</span></span></a><span><span> race together next month).</span></span></p>

<p>By the time we'd got back, found we were locked out in the freezing cold and rain (I was turning purple), knocked on people's doors to find a ladder, managed to scale the side of the house to get back inside and finally showered and defrosted, we were starving so we set off for lunch at <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/place?cid=15666020981016691371&amp;q=soul+food,+christchurch"><span><span>Soul Food</span></span></a><span><span>. It was a bit of a challenge to find but that may have been because we hadn't looked on the map beforehand and were starving!</span></span></p>

<p>I started with a drink...organic cola.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYVlWYolI/AAAAAAAAC6E/SOpp3LrL0-M/s400/IMG_2779.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It didn't last long.

<p>After reading about the Vegan BLT on </p></span></span><a href="http://fairestfeed.blogspot.com/"><span><span>The Fairest Feed</span></span></a><span><span> I knew as soon as I saw it in the counter that it was what I wanted.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYWuGfKsI/AAAAAAAAC6I/nbzplnNvS54/s400/IMG_2780.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I have to say that it totally lived up to expectations. It was SO good - the bread was deliciously fresh, the bacon was awesome but I think it was the sauces that really made it (vegan aioli or mayonaise?). The side salad was also delicious. So if you ever find yourself at Soul Food...get the BLT!

<p>B ordered the Vege Burger which was also vegan. This had a pattie made from brown rice (and a few other things) as well as vegan aioli and served inside a grainy bun.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYX1NnVxI/AAAAAAAAC6M/nI4V26zWWRo/s400/IMG_2783.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It was pretty tasty (I snuck a bit off his plate) but not nearly as good as the BLT.

<p>Finally they had some sweet vegan options so dessert was required. I got a muffin which I think was apricot and apple...maybe (okay, I'm sure about the apricot part but not about the apple part).</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYZVfpW8I/AAAAAAAAC6Q/lGzGiEPtNNc/s400/IMG_2784.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It had a really nice texture which reminded me of spelt and a delicious dob of icing on top. Yay, lunch mission accomplished!

<p>After lunch (and having a bit of a lie-down after eating too much!) we headed off to </p></span></span><a href="http://www.theroxx.co.nz/"><span><span>The Roxx</span></span></a><span><span>, the indoor climbing wall at Christchurch. We were hoping to head outside for my first taste of climbing on real rock but the weather wasn't up for it.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPdsO-KDeI/AAAAAAAAC7c/pjqs93p0o7Y/s400/IMG_2787.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
The Roxx isn't nearly as big as </span></span><a href="http://extremeedge.co.nz/"><span><span>Extreme Edge</span></span></a><span><span> which is where I climb in Auckland but it has some pretty crazy climbs. Good fun but I was a bit disappointed we couldn't climb outside.

<p>Dinner was planned for </p></span></span><a href="http://www.thelotusheart.co.nz/"><span><span>The Lotus Heart</span></span></a><span><span> restaurant in Cathedral Square, which we'd both been to before. Since we were running late we didn't bother going home to change and just rocked up in our climbing gear (minus the harnesses and stuff...we're not </span></span><em><span><span>that</span></span></em><span><span> crazy!).

<p>I am rather partial to a good ginger beer so when I noticed they had a housemade ginger beer on the menu that had to be ordered.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYaOKM4II/AAAAAAAAC6U/gz-IA9sN2lg/s400/IMG_2789.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Delicious (although it could have been a bit more gingery). I liked how it wasn't super fizzy either. We started off the meal with a bowl of fries with tomato sauce because, well, we could...

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYbv1EyUI/AAAAAAAAC6Y/1yTLISiBuXE/s400/IMG_2792.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I don't know what kind of seasoning they used but it was very tasty.

<p>For some reason I really felt like a burger despite having had a sandwich for lunch and their Sun Burger caught my eye. It's described as a "live" burger pattie with salad, salsa and vegan aioli in an essene bun.</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh4.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYc7dhbbI/AAAAAAAAC6c/U33LA1h9Oec/s400/IMG_2794.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
This was a seriously good burger - delicious and also a bit different. Their vegan aoli is really good and totally made the burger otherwise it might have potentially been a bit dry and helped make the burger not taste so dense. This meal was probably the highlight of the day.

<p>The Lotus Heart has an actual dessert menu and as a vegan you have more than one option! Having come here before I knew I had to try something different from </p></span></span><a href="http://goddessvaala.blogspot.com/2008/10/city-of-tropics.html"><span><span>last time</span></span></a><span><span>.

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh3.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/StPYeMjvajI/AAAAAAAAC6g/Gvfz387qkNE/s400/IMG_2799.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
Yeah, chocolate cake caught my eye! Served with raspberry sorbet (which was really good despite the fact I don't normally like berry sorbets) it was intensely rich and awesome. I didn't want it to end!</span></span>

Ooo, last day of OZ &amp; NZ VeganMoFo...and I survived! It was fun but to be honest it's a relief we've reached the end! I haven't exactly had the best month and I certainly haven't made anything particularly interesting. I had all these good intentions but it just never worked out!</span></span></p>

<p>A lot is going on round here that isn't food related. I've got a few events coming up that I'm training for which leaves me feeling pretty exhausted and my arms feel dead from an epic climbing session last night. Today is also rather stressful at work after the news of the tsunami in Samoa as we've got a film crew heading over there in a couple of weeks. We're trying to work out what locations are still usable and what isn't and what on earth we're going to do.</p>

<p>Anyway, here's my lunch for today...couscous salad with roasted vegetables from Revel.</p>

<p></p><center><span><span><img src="http://lh5.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SsKp7GbeU5I/AAAAAAAAC4k/sof8PUcWgpc/s400/IMG_2763.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
It wasn't one of their most exciting salads but it filled the spot and was still pretty tasty.

<p>A few days ago I was having a really bad night and I couldn't think of what to eat. I didn't want toast or cereal and I had hardly any veges in my fridge. I didn't feel up to cooking anything and it also had to be something comforting. What to do?</p>

<p></p></span></span><center><span><span><img src="http://lh6.ggpht.com/_p8sUOddfSEk/SqordBDTNsI/AAAAAAAAC0o/tieGudGEa4A/s400/IMG_2694.JPG" alt="" title=""></span></span></center><span><span> <br>
I ended up settling on cooking up some kumara chips (thank god for our convection oven), carrot chips and peanut butter. Not balanced in any way but if homemade kumara chips can't cheer me up then I don't know what will!</span></span>
