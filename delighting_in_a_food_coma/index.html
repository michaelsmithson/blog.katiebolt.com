- <em>Emma</em> by Jane Austen</span></p>

<p>Hello! We're busy playing the 'guess how big that aftershock was' game after a rather large shake (it knocked a few things out of our pantry so it's got to be at least a 5. Extra points for guessing where it was centred. You might laugh but some people had bets on one at work once!).</p>

<p>M and I have spent most of the day in a food coma after eating up large at the <a href="http://www.vegetarianexpo.org.nz/">vegetarian expo</a> and then eating lots of cake and bread at his parents' house (his Mum made this vegan orange cake especially for us. I think I'm going to have to get the recipe off her because it was delicious). I have to say though, a food coma is a bit more pleasant than the total exhaustion state we were both in last night after a rogaine based out of <a href="http://maps.google.co.nz/maps?q=castle+hill+village,+canterbury&amp;hl=en&amp;ll=-43.206177,171.728668&amp;spn=0.670659,1.601257&amp;sll=-41.244772,172.617188&amp;sspn=43.960078,68.994141&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;hnear=Castle+Hill,+Canterbury&amp;t=h&amp;z=10">Castle Hill</a> (it was crazy - we started in a snowfall and finished in beautiful sunshine a few hours later!).</p>

<p>First up, before we even got inside, we got vegetarian sausages with all the trimmings (mustard, sweet chilli sauce, onions and tomato sauce). I devoured mine in no time because I was starving (only having an apple for breakfast will do that for you...but I was determined to eat far too much at the expo so had to make sure there was going to be room). I think the sausages they used were the <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/">Frys</a> ones. Later, inside the expo, I had a good chat to the people from Frys about their <a href="http://www.frysvegetarian.co.za/products/frys-vegetarian/introducing-4-new-products/">new products</a> which are coming soon and I got all excited!</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-WTYi33zIDtQ/TpFhzK_bkKI/AAAAAAAAFNs/-jYpgLzd7iI/s640/food01.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Next up I got all excited by these tiny little cupcakes and the vegan society stall so I had to get one of the lemon ones. It was eaten in no time (you could have eaten the whole thing in one go but I tried to make it last a bit longer).

<p>I then downed a shot glass of vegan beer from the <a href="http://casselsbrewery.co.nz/">Cassels &amp; Sons Brewery</a>. Now that was quite nice and I might have to pop out there and get some but it was a bit early for me and alcohol to meet (11am). I think I got a whole lot more giggly after that.</p>

<p>Then it was time for some serious browsing of the stalls (while I giggled continuously and got all excited at the smallest of things). This didn't last all that long because I stumbled across another stall selling the most amazing looking vegan baking. <a href="http://www.catrescue.org.nz/">Cat Rescue Christchurch</a> had a big table filled with delicious-looking home baking but my eye was instantly caught by the ginger crunch so I had to have some of that.</p>

<p>After the mini sugar coma I was now in we decided something savoury was in order. We'd thought about pies but ended up going for samosas with chutney from, well I can't remember where from but they were delicious and very spicy.</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-8Ykh_XlfETM/TpFhz809jAI/AAAAAAAAFNw/hmP1Fcv_I8s/s640/food02.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
Drink was definitely required after that but when we wandered over to The Lotus Heart stall I got carried away and ended up getting a slice of raw lemon cheesecake instead!! It was divine. They have got this whole raw dessert thing down to a T (or is it a little t? I've never written that phrase down before). Luckily M was a bit more sensible and bought us some sparkling orange and ginger drink to share.

<p>You'd think we'd be full by now but the pies were still calling. We ended up getting a Country Pie to share from the <a href="http://www.lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/">Linda McCartney Foods</a> stall. The pastry was delicious but the filling was slightly too 'meaty' for my taste. M seemed to like it though.</p>

<p>Then just to top it off, I'd come to the realisation I hadn't gotten anything chocolaty yet so I headed back to the lovely ladies at <a href="http://www.catrescue.org.nz/">Cat Rescue Christchurch</a>. I don't know who you ladies are but you do amazing work and are incredible bakers. When we have somewhere where I can have a cat I am totally heading your way. Anyway, I picked up a slice of peppermint chocolate cake which I picked at once we got home (it was incredible).</p>

<p></p><center><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pQQ0QMPZfZU/TpFhSaM8TCI/AAAAAAAAFNo/grZOVaeIJlE/s640/food03.jpg" alt="" title=""></center> <br>
So yeah, basically the vegetarian expo was awesome and I'm most grateful for the lady at work who told me about it. As you can probably guess by this post (and like I said on the feedback form afterwards), I was pretty much just there for the food and it did not disappoint.

<p>By the way, for those who were curious, the official quake magnitude is now up and it was a 5.5. Exciting!</p>
